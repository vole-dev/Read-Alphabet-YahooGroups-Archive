The upper case constant mappings are <br/>\n<br/>\nsimilar to other key mapping proposals.<br/>\n<br/>\n-all lower case vowel keys say the usual short vowel sounds: ie: &#39;a <br/>\ne i o u&#39; map to the vowel sounds in the words _bat_, _bet_, _bit_, <br/>\n_bot_ (british english accent - not merged american) and _but_ <br/>\nrespectively.<br/>\n<br/>\n-all upper case vowels say their own name: ie: &#39;A E I O U&#39; map to <br/>\nthe vowel sounds in the words _say_, _see_, _sigh_, _sew_, _sue_ <br/>\n(well &#39;U&#39; sort of says its name)<br/>\n<br/>\n-upper case &#39;R&#39; says its own name. ie: &#39;R&#39; maps to the vowel sound <br/>\nin _car_<br/>\n<br/>\n-upper case &#39;W&#39; and &#39;Y&#39; map to the vowel sounds in the words _cow_ <br/>\nand _coy_<br/>\n<br/>\n-upper case &#39;Q&#39; maps to the vowel sound in the word _core_. (&#39;Q&#39; <br/>\nsort of looks like an &#39;o&#39;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-upper case &#39;V&#39; maps to the vowel sound in the word _cook_. (just <br/>\nhave to learn this one)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n# Comments on this revision :<br/>\n<br/>\n- the mapping is now logically split between lower and upper case. <br/>\nAll lower case sound/key mappings are commonly experienced in <br/>\neveryday english. Whereas upper case sound/key combinations may not <br/>\nbe common nor feel as logical.<br/>\n<br/>\n- there are now two lower case keys that are not mapped, &#39;c&#39; <br/>\nand &#39;q&#39;.  These keys could be used in a quikscripters personal <br/>\nkeyboard mapping as an alternative to two of the mapped upper case <br/>\nkeys. Doing this eliminates some shift key presses.<br/>\n<br/>\n- the lower case keys map to the most of the most frequently used <br/>\nletters.  Approximately 85% of text only requires lower case key <br/>\nstrokes (according to the quikscript letter frequency chart in the <br/>\nfiles/resources folder). If you personally map &#39;c&#39; and &#39;q&#39; to <br/>\nthe &#39;eight&#39; and &#39;they&#39; letters then this increases to approx 90%, <br/>\nie: only 10% of letters typed in normal text require a shift key <br/>\npress.<br/>\n<br/>\n- there are now more &#39;null&#39; and &#39;utter&#39; mappings compared to the <br/>\noriginal proposal.  Although these extra mappings can be used to <br/>\nfurther improve english font readability, I feel that the principle <br/>\nthat a mapping should minimise null and multiple mappings has much <br/>\nmerit.  I&#39;m very open to dicussion about the reducing the number of <br/>\nthese extra mappings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n# Reasons for me wanting to increase english font readability:<br/>\n<br/>\n- 1. For use when writing for the general public and not <br/>\nspecifically for quikscripters.  This offers a way to improve <br/>\nquikscript awareness. Eg: a web page that is written in quikscript <br/>\nwill still be readable (with effort) by non-quikscripters, ideally <br/>\nsuch a web page would provide a link to explain why the writing is <br/>\nstrange and offer a chance for the readers to learn more about <br/>\nquikscript.  (This is my personal primary motivation as it is a <br/>\nsituation that I&#39;m currently facing with one of my websites that is <br/>\nwritten in quikscript.  The website is about a free GPL&#39;ed booking <br/>\nkeeping program that I&#39;m coding.  I&#39;m thinking about writing all the <br/>\ndialog and help messages within the program in quikscript as well.)<br/>\n<br/>\n- 2. Even if users are not interested in learning QS per se, by <br/>\nhaving them read text which is basically a phonemic mapping <br/>\nincreases their phonemic awareness and lighlights the obsurdity that <br/>\ntraditional english spelling has degenerated to. Realising the <br/>\nobsurdity of TO is half the battle of spelling reform.  (I <br/>\npersonally found that learning the QS alphabet itself to be very <br/>\neasy.  The real challenge I had of writing QS lies in being able to <br/>\nphonemically sound out words.  Many times I would write a word how I <br/>\nthought it sounded only to find that the dictionary pronounced it <br/>\ndifferent.  At first I would think that the dictionary was wrong, <br/>\nuntil I listened very carefully to how the word was normally <br/>\npronounced.  A major cause of this error was that the traditional <br/>\nspellings were negatively biasing how I perceived the sounds of <br/>\nwords.)<br/>\n<br/>\n- 3. People new to QS can use the english font readability to ease <br/>\nthemselves into QS.  By first reading text (such as the QS-news <br/>\nfeeds) in an english font they can increase their phonemic <br/>\nawareness.  Then they can gradually introduce new QS letters every <br/>\nfew days by using find/replace to replace the english font with a QS <br/>\nfont for each new letter.  (Of course, instead of doing this font <br/>\nreplacement manually, some super-techie quickscripter would be able <br/>\nto write a small program that downloads the news-feed and does this <br/>\nautomatically for them :)  ).  This would result in a progressive <br/>\ntutorial approach like my Alice-in-Wonderland tutes, except they <br/>\nexplicitly control how fast and in which order they progress to each <br/>\nnew letter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMerry Christmas All<br/>\nPeter</div>",

(just \nhave to learn this one)\n\n\n\n# Comments on this revision =\r\n:\n\n- the mapping is now logically split between lower and upper case. \nAll =\r\nlower case sound/key mappings are commonly experienced in \neveryday english=\r\n. Whereas upper case sound/key combinations may not \nbe common nor feel as =\r\nlogical.\n\n- there are now two lower case keys that are not mapped, &#39;c&#39; \nand=\r\n &#39;q&#39;.  These keys could be used in a quikscripters personal \nkeyboard mappi=\r\nng as an alternative to two of the mapped upper case \nkeys. Doing this elim=\r\ninates some shift key presses.\n\n- the lower case keys map to the most of th=\r\ne most frequently used \nletters.  Approximately 85% of text only requires l=\r\nower case key \nstrokes (according to the quikscript letter frequency chart =\r\nin the \nfiles/resources folder). If you personally map &#39;c&#39; and &#39;q&#39; to \nthe =\r\n&#39;eight&#39; and &#39;they&#39; letters then this increases to approx 90%, \nie: only 10%=\r\n of letters typed in normal text require a shift key \npress.\n\n- there are n=\r\now more &#39;null&#39; and &#39;utter&#39; mappings compared to the \noriginal proposal.  Al=\r\nthough these extra mappings can be used to \nfurther improve english font re=\r\nadability, I feel that the principle \nthat a mapping should minimise null a=\r\nnd multiple mappings has much \nmerit.  I&#39;m very open to dicussion about the=\r\n reducing the number of \nthese extra mappings.\n\n\n\n# Reasons for me wanting =\r\nto increase english font readability:\n\n- 1. For use when writing for the ge=\r\nneral public and not \nspecifically for quikscripters.  This offers a way to=\r\n improve \nquikscript awareness. Eg: a web page that is written in quikscrip=\r\nt \nwill still be readable (with effort) by non-quikscripters, ideally \nsuch=\r\n a web page would provide a link to explain why the writing is \nstrange and=\r\n offer a chance for the readers to learn more about \nquikscript.  (This is =\r\nmy personal primary motivation as it is a \nsituation that I&#39;m currently fac=\r\ning with one of my websites that is \nwritten in quikscript.  The website is=\r\n about a free GPL&#39;ed booking \nkeeping program that I&#39;m coding.  I&#39;m thinkin=\r\ng about writing all the \ndialog and help messages within the program in qui=\r\nkscript as well.)\n\n- 2. Even if users are not interested in learning QS per=\r\n se, by \nhaving them read text which is basically a phonemic mapping \nincre=\r\nases their phonemic awareness and lighlights the obsurdity that \ntraditiona=\r\nl english spelling has degenerated to. Realising the \nobsurdity of TO is ha=\r\nlf the battle of spelling reform.  (I \npersonally found that learning the Q=\r\nS alphabet itself to be very \neasy.  The real challenge I had of writing QS=\r\n lies in being able to \nphonemically sound out words.  Many times I would w=\r\nrite a word how I \nthought it sounded only to find that the dictionary pron=\r\nounced it \ndifferent.  At first I would think that the dictionary was wrong=\r\n, \nuntil I listened very carefully to how the word was normally \npronounced=\r\n.  A major cause of this error was that the traditional \nspellings were neg=\r\natively biasing how I perceived the sounds of \nwords.)\n\n- 3. People new to =\r\nQS can use the english font readability to ease \nthemselves into QS.  By fi=\r\nrst reading text (such as the QS-news \nfeeds) in an english font they can i=\r\nncrease their phonemic \nawareness.  Then they can gradually introduce new Q=\r\nS letters every \nfew days by using find/replace to replace the english font=\r\n with a QS \nfont for each new letter.  (Of course, instead of doing this fo=\r\nnt \nreplacement manually, some super-techie quickscripter would be able \nto=\r\n write a small program that downloads the news-feed and does this \nautomati=\r\ncally for them :)  ).  This would result in a progressive \ntutorial approac=\r\nh like my Alice-in-Wonderland tutes, except they \nexplicitly control how fa=\r\nst and in which order they progress to each \nnew letter.\n\n\n\nMerry Christmas=\r\n All\nPeter\n\n\n\n\n"
