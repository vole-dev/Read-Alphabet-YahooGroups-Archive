  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1505185858\">Earlier I suggested a vote to choose a standard for this group for an<br/>\nASCII representation of QS. This would serve two purposes: (1) it<br/>\nwould provide a standard for QS fonts, and (2) it would provide a<br/>\nsimple format for QS document exchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral proposals have been made already. I&#39;ve put them in a<br/>\nspreadsheet and uploaded the file (see link below).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scope of the proposals is the 40 core QS letters, the 4 alternate<br/>\nletters, the two letters used for Scottish, Welsh and Irish place<br/>\nnames, and the name dot and two angled brackets. To be complete, each<br/>\nentry should thus have 49 assignments. Assignments should be 7-bit<br/>\nASCII (ie no accented characters). I suggest using only upper and<br/>\nlower case Roman letters for the 46 QS letters. For those who have<br/>\nalready made entries, please send me any updates you&#39;d like me to make<br/>\nand I&#39;ll edit the spreadsheet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have developed your own key mapping proposal, please send it to<br/>\nme and I&#39;ll add it to the spreadsheet.
