Midnight, Jack Armstrong, etc. &nbsp;I use it to write down what I would not want anyone else to read or know about which is really not often.</div><div><br></div><div>My own experience in correspondence was that it was brief. &nbsp;I wrote to a man in New Zealand for awhile but unless one has a particular common interest in some matter the correspondence begins to wear thin after awhile.\n &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The last point about not being a purist about Read&#39;s alphabets is that others -- I believe it was Mr. Page, was it not? who developed a revised version of Read&#39;s alphabet which I was tempted to send for. &nbsp;And, I have noticed even in Esperanto that &quot;x&quot; I believe became a &quot;ch&quot; character that Zamenhoff did not create at the time it became popular. &nbsp;My point here is that human nature likes to tinker with such matters -- languages change, alphabets get altered, etc. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It might be if there is enough interest that some people will get together and in some way try to integrate both Shaw&#39;s alphabet and QS or accept a further revision of Read&#39;s work. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think it would be a heresy to take an interest in the advantages, if any, in adopting a more practical or aesthetic approach. &nbsp; The point here of my own interest is whether his language creations have benefits that have not\n been thoroughly covered</div><div><br></div><div>Sid<br><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On <b>Fri, 8/19/11, Sid Tanaban <i>&lt;sidban2@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<br><blockquote style=\"border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin-left:5px;padding-left:5px;\"><br>From: Sid Tanaban &lt;sidban2@...&gt;<br>Subject: Re: [Read_Alphabet] Re: I&#39;d like to be able to write the prefixes com- and con- as contractions<br>To: Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com<br>Date: Friday, August 19, 2011, 8:04 PM<br><br><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-748389748yiv1173927453\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<span>&nbsp;</span>\n\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-748389748yiv1173927453ygrp-text\">\n      \n      \n      <p><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td valign=\"top\" style=\"font:inherit;\">Mr. Read was quite willing to abandon the Shaw&#39;s alphabet and use other letters that he thought more suitable. &nbsp;It was his opinion -- not a scientific rule! &nbsp;My opinion would be if you do not like &quot;o&quot; then use the &quot;uh&quot; of Shaw&#39;s alphabet. &nbsp;Actually, I recognize that very easily. &nbsp;I studied Shaw&#39;s alphabet before QS and think some of the letters are much more aesthetically drawn. &nbsp;And, that would be my viewpoint about other questions about such a matter. &nbsp;Mr. Read may or may not have been dogmatic about what he created but it is really preferable for your own use to choose what is delightful and easy to read. &nbsp;After all, do you want to view this as one would view the Bible? &nbsp;The script is only a tool for one&#39;s own pleasure and surely a minor change is not going to harm readability, particularly when everyone\n is sounding\n out these words according to their own particular use of English anyway.<div><br></div><div>I am sure someone will object to what I have to say and I would be curious if someone feels that there is something I have overlooked. &nbsp;If so, please convey your thought on it.</div><div>Sid<br><br>--- On <b>Fri, 8/19/11, cossyrosario <i>&lt;cossyrosario@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<br><blockquote style=\"border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);\"><br>From: cossyrosario &lt;cossyrosario@...&gt;<br>Subject: [Read_Alphabet] Re: I&#39;d like to be able to write the prefixes com- and con- as contractions<br>To: Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com<br>Date: Friday, August 19, 2011, 12:28 PM<br><br><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-748389748yiv1173927453\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<span>&nbsp;</span>\n\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-748389748yiv1173927453ygrp-text\">\n      \n      \n      <p>What is T.O.?<br>\nTraditional Orthodox?

After all, this is what we do with T.O.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt; I think the use of a letter that represents a different sound in place<br>\n&gt; of the correct letter, would be counter productive and harmful to your<br>\n&gt; comprehension.  I would just advise you to realize that QS does not<br>\n&gt; require that every letter be joined to every other letter.  QS is<br>\nquite<br>\n&gt; cursive as Read designed it.

=C2=A0Shaw wanted a phonetic alphabet and more abb=\r\nreviated so he could fit more letters on a page. =C2=A0However, my sense wa=\r\ns that the more abbreviated strokes often make one hesitate unless one is e=\r\nither accustomed to it or can take slight alterations of the letter in stri=\r\nde.\nFor example, the &quot;uh&quot; in kom in the QS could suffer from readability if=\r\n written quickly in a cursive link. =C2=A0The pause for readability would p=\r\nrevent fluid readability that would not be the case with an alphabet shorth=\r\nand since we are more accustomed to the latin letters which are a bit more =\r\nelaborated.\nFrankly, I began to think of the alphabets as more of a secret =\r\ncode such as I use to get from old-time radio programs as Capt. Midnight, J=\r\nack Armstrong, etc. =C2=A0I use it to write down what I would not want anyo=\r\nne else to read or know about which is really not often.\nMy own experience =\r\nin correspondence was that it was brief. =C2=A0I wrote to a man in New Zeal=\r\nand for awhile but unless one has a particular common interest in some matt=\r\ner the correspondence begins to wear thin after awhile. =C2=A0\nThe last poi=\r\nnt about not being a purist about Read&#39;s alphabets is that others -- I beli=\r\neve it was Mr. Page, was it not? who developed a revised version of Read&#39;s =\r\nalphabet which I was tempted to send for. =C2=A0And, I have noticed even in=\r\n Esperanto that &quot;x&quot; I believe became a &quot;ch&quot; character that Zamenhoff did no=\r\nt create at the time it became popular. =C2=A0My point here is that human n=\r\nature likes to tinker with such matters -- languages change, alphabets get =\r\naltered, etc. =C2=A0\nIt might be if there is enough interest that some peop=\r\nle will get together and in some way try to integrate both Shaw&#39;s alphabet =\r\nand QS or accept a further revision of Read&#39;s work. =C2=A0I don&#39;t think it =\r\nwould be a heresy to take an interest in the advantages, if any, in adoptin=\r\ng a more practical or aesthetic approach. =C2=A0 The point here of my own i=\r\nnterest is whether his language creations have benefits that have not been =\r\nthoroughly covered\nSid\n\n--- On Fri, 8/19/11, Sid Tanaban &lt;sidban2@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Sid Tanaban &lt;sidban2@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [Read_Alphabet=\r\n] Re: I&#39;d like to be able to write the prefixes com- and con- as contractio=\r\nns\nTo: Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Friday, August 19, 2011, 8:04 PM=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      Mr. Read was quit=\r\ne willing to abandon the Shaw&#39;s alphabet and use other letters that he thou=\r\nght more suitable. =C2=A0It was his opinion -- not a scientific rule! =C2=\r\n=A0My opinion would be if you do not like &quot;o&quot; then use the &quot;uh&quot; of Shaw&#39;s a=\r\nlphabet. =C2=A0Actually, I recognize that very easily. =C2=A0I studied Shaw=\r\n&#39;s alphabet before QS and think some of the letters are much more aesthetic=\r\nally drawn. =C2=A0And, that would be my viewpoint about other questions abo=\r\nut such a matter. =C2=A0Mr. Read may or may not have been dogmatic about wh=\r\nat he created but it is really preferable for your own use to choose what i=\r\ns delightful and easy to read. =C2=A0After all, do you want to view this as=\r\n one would view the Bible? =C2=A0The script is only a tool for one&#39;s own pl=\r\neasure and surely a minor change is not going to harm readability, particul=\r\narly when everyone is sounding\n out these words according to their own part=\r\nicular use of English anyway.\nI am sure someone will object to what I have =\r\nto say and I would be curious if someone feels that there is something I ha=\r\nve overlooked. =C2=A0If so, please convey your thought on it.Sid\n\n--- On Fr=\r\ni, 8/19/11, cossyrosario &lt;cossyrosario@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: cossyrosa=\r\nrio &lt;cossyrosario@...&gt;\nSubject: [Read_Alphabet] Re: I&#39;d like to be =\r\nable to write the prefixes com- and con- as contractions\nTo: Read_Alphabet@=\r\nyahoogroups.com\nDate: Friday, August 19, 2011, 12:28 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n=\r\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      What is T.O.?\n\nTraditional Orthodox?

Midnight, Jack Armstrong, etc. &nbsp;I use it to =\r\nwrite down what I would not want anyone else to read or know about which is=\r\n really not often.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My own experience in correspond=\r\nence was that it was brief. &nbsp;I wrote to a man in New Zealand for awhil=\r\ne but unless one has a particular common interest in some matter the corres=\r\npondence begins to wear thin after awhile.\n &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;The last point about not being a purist about Read&#39;s alphabets is that oth=\r\ners -- I believe it was Mr. Page, was it not? who developed a revised versi=\r\non of Read&#39;s alphabet which I was tempted to send for. &nbsp;And, I have no=\r\nticed even in Esperanto that &quot;x&quot; I believe became a &quot;ch&quot; character that Zam=\r\nenhoff did not create at the time it became popular. &nbsp;My point here is=\r\n that human nature likes to tinker with such matters -- languages change, a=\r\nlphabets get altered, etc. &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It might be if t=\r\nhere is enough interest that some people will get together and in some way =\r\ntry to integrate both Shaw&#39;s alphabet and QS or accept a further revision o=\r\nf Read&#39;s work. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think it would be a heresy to take an interest=\r\n in the advantages, if any, in adopting a more practical or aesthetic appro=\r\nach. &nbsp; The point here of my own interest is whether his language creat=\r\nions have benefits that have not\n been thoroughly covered&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sid&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Fri, 8/19/11, Sid Tanaban &lt;i&gt;&lt;sidban2@yahoo=\r\n.com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(=\r\n16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: Sid Tanaban &=\r\nlt;sidban2@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re: [Read_Alphabet] Re: I&#39;d like to be=\r\n able to write the prefixes com- and con- as contractions&lt;br&gt;To: Read_Alpha=\r\nbet@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date: Friday, August 19, 2011, 8:04 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div i=\r\nd=3D&quot;yiv1173927453&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1173927453ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;tab=\r\nle cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=\r\n=3D&quot;top&quot; style=3D&quot;font:inherit;&quot;&gt;Mr. Read was quite willing to abandon the =\r\nShaw&#39;s alphabet and use other letters that he thought more suitable. &nbsp;=\r\nIt was his opinion -- not a scientific rule! &nbsp;My opinion would be if y=\r\nou do not like &quot;o&quot; then use the &quot;uh&quot; of Shaw&#39;s alphabet. &nbsp;Actually, I =\r\nrecognize that very easily. &nbsp;I studied Shaw&#39;s alphabet before QS and t=\r\nhink some of the letters are much more aesthetically drawn. &nbsp;And, that=\r\n would be my viewpoint about other questions about such a matter. &nbsp;Mr.=\r\n Read may or may not have been dogmatic about what he created but it is rea=\r\nlly preferable for your own use to choose what is delightful and easy to re=\r\nad. &nbsp;After all, do you want to view this as one would view the Bible? =\r\n&nbsp;The script is only a tool for one&#39;s own pleasure and surely a minor c=\r\nhange is not going to harm readability, particularly when everyone\n is soun=\r\nding\n out these words according to their own particular use of English anyw=\r\nay.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am sure someone will object to what I have to say =\r\nand I would be curious if someone feels that there is something I have over=\r\nlooked. &nbsp;If so, please convey your thought on it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sid&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Fri, 8/19/11, cossyrosario &lt;i&gt;&lt;cossyrosario@...&gt;&lt;/=\r\ni&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255=\r\n);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: cossyrosario &lt;cossyrosario@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [Re=\r\nad_Alphabet] Re: I&#39;d like to be able to write the prefixes com- and con- as=\r\n contractions&lt;br&gt;To: Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date: Friday, August =\r\n19, 2011, 12:28 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1173927453&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n&lt;span&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1173927453ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n     =\r\n &lt;p&gt;What is T.O.?&lt;br&gt;\nTraditional Orthodox?
