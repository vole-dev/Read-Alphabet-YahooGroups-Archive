There are some dialects in which different words are <br/>\npronounced exactly the same, and one can only tell what the word means <br/>\nby context. I had an Irish friend many years back who pronounced &quot;my&quot; as <br/>\n&quot;me.&quot; In my own case, I pronounce &quot;women&quot; as &quot;womun.&quot; The singular and <br/>\nthe plural have no difference for me. But I would never think of writing <br/>\nboth words identical, certainly not in TO, but really not in QS, either. <br/>\nWhat would be the purpose? In the same vein, I think dialects such as <br/>\nthe one you describe would naturally write in a standard dialect. I <br/>\nthink you are bringing up a rare case, one in which some speakers <br/>\ndistinguish between two words with sounds that others would not be able <br/>\nto hear.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy understanding is that QS does have enough phonemes to describe <br/>\neveryone&#39;s dialect. If there are lots of cases in which speakers use the <br/>\nsame sound, but in different ways to mean a different word, that means <br/>\nthat there are more than 40 phonemes, and that QS is inadequate in how <br/>\nit was devised and how we think of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you are saying that the sit-seat people should use different QS <br/>\nletters to distinguish between their words, but aren&#39;t you just <br/>\ndescribing a variation of TO? If you say that the words are different <br/>\nand that we are going to assign them letters not necessarily on how they <br/>\nsound, but just to distinguish them, then we are moving away from the <br/>\nphonomical basis for QS and towards the rigid spelling of TO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Also, you have not described what you mean by phonemical opposition.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re right: I danced around the definition without making it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A phonemic opposition between two sounds exists in a given language when<br/>\n&gt; there are two words of the language, one of which pronounced with one<br/>\n&gt; sound and the other with the other, with no other differences between<br/>\n&gt; them. The two words are called a &quot;minimal pair&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thus the sounds written &quot;p&quot; in &quot;spin&quot; and &quot;pin&quot; don&#39;t constitute a<br/>\n&gt; phonemic opposition in English: the first sound is used only after<br/>\n&gt; &quot;s&quot;, the other in all other cases, so there can be no minimal pairs.<br/>\n&gt; However, &quot;pin&quot; and &quot;bin&quot; do constitute a minimal pair, and so there<br/>\n&gt; is a phonemic opposition between the &quot;p&quot; and &quot;b&quot; sounds in English.<br/>\n&gt; In the Hindi language, there are minimal pairs for all three sounds,<br/>\n&gt; and consequently three separate phonemes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But I don&#39;t think you can really base QS on phonemic opposition. It is <br/>\nmore complicated than what I am suggesting. Of course, I understand that <br/>\none can use phonemical opposition without understanding the principal <br/>\nbehind it, but I don&#39;t see it as really a good way to describe how QS <br/>\nworks. Aren&#39;t you just talking about the difference between phonemes and <br/>\nallophones?<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I am a bit against your using phonemical opposition to <br/>\ndescribe QS (I don&#39;t fully understand it), but if you can make a case <br/>\nfor why it describes QS better than what I propose, then I would <br/>\ndefinitely change my mind. I just read over Read&#39;s manual, and he <br/>\nglosses over the problems we are discussing. He notes that words in <br/>\ncontext change their pronounciation, so that really QS is not strictly <br/>\nphonemical. But then he switches to the word &quot;The&quot; and how we should <br/>\nwrite it. So he brings up a critical matter, and then limits it to one <br/>\nword. I think Read did more or less envision that QS covered all the <br/>\nphonemes in the English speaking world. He was wrong in thinking that <br/>\nthe upper class British English would serve as a model for other <br/>\ndialects, and I think his limitation is causing confusion now.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a final note for tonight, I think my proposal suggets we handle <br/>\nproblems on a case by case basis. If for example, we need to determine <br/>\nthat the sit-seat dialect needs to use certain letters to distinguish <br/>\nsounds, I see no reason not to state that. We could still use precise <br/>\nlanguage. We could say that in such and such a dialect, the words &quot;sit&quot; <br/>\nan &quot;seat&quot; are pronounced with the /I/, but that in order to distinguish <br/>\nthese vowels, speakers in this dialect should either use a standard <br/>\ndialect X, or they can use the /I/ sound for X, and the /i/ for X.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul</div>",
