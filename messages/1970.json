I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that I shouldn&#39;t include the <br>\nalternative nor half letters within the 7 bit ACSII range. eg: I <br>\nwould not map them to the latin lower nor uppercase letters. These <br>\nletters, I would place in the extended ACSII range.  By placing them <br>\nthere it deliberately makes it more difficult for people to type <br>\nthem thus discouraging people from using these letters.   (Note: I <br>\nwould still map the letters for &quot;ks&quot;, &quot;gz&quot;, loch and llan to the <br>\nlatin letters.  Since there is only one grapheme for these letters.)<br>\n<br>\nI donot support the use of alternative letters for typed text for <br>\nthe following reasons:<br>\n-most people would be too lazy to type the alternatives instead they <br>\nwould just use the one form.  This has happened with traditional <br>\northography once the strict formal requirement for capitalization of <br>\nletters at the start of sentences is relaxed- eg: in less formal <br>\ncommunications such as phone texting or internet messaging where <br>\npeople choose to use only the lower case. <br>\n-causes inconsistency in typed text.  Some people would use junior, <br>\nsome a combination of junior and senior while others (I think very <br>\nfew though) would use true senior.<br>\n-slows down typing until all the various letter combinations that <br>\noccur have been learnt.  ie: Initially have to pause and think which <br>\nalternative to use before it becomes automatic to type<br>\n-if quikscript was ever to become widely popular and printed <br>\nmaterial was published in quikscript I would be very surprised if <br>\npublishers used senior.  This is due to the fact that fluent reading <br>\nof senior script requires further learning and more practise than <br>\njunior. I image that publishers would publish text in the junior <br>\nversion so that could be read by the greatest number.  I&#39;m an <br>\nexample of this, I can read junior fluently but have not bothered to <br>\nlearn senior.<br>\n-the junior looks more uniform and neat than the senior when typed <br>\n(well it does to me anyway).<br>\n<br>\nIf people do want to produce or read senior text, than this would <br>\nbest be achieved by using software to convert typed junior (or a <br>\njunior/senior mix) into true senior (or a specific mix of <br>\njunior/senior).  Software would produce a more consistent and <br>\naccurate senior text than manual methods.<br>\n<br>\nIf some people really do want to type the senior alternatives <br>\nregularly they could use a keyboard mapping* that maps an &quot;alt-gr&quot; <br>\nkeypress combined with the junior key for the letter.  Eg: half-poe <br>\nwould then be typed &quot;alt-gr&quot;+&quot;p&quot;.<br>\n<br>\nI feel that senior is best left for advanced handwriting and junior <br>\nfor typed text.<br>\n<br>\n*Just to clear up terminology a bit. <br>\nThe term &quot;keyboard mapping&quot; has not been used correctly all the time <br>\nin the group here (I&#39;ve personally been very guilty of this).  What <br>\nhave been doing and discussing is applying ASCII/Latin1 character <br>\ncodes to the quikscript graphemes.<br>\nA  keyboard mapping maps actual keys/key-press-combinations on the <br>\nkeyboard to character codes. <br>\n<br>\n</p>\n    </div>  \n\n    \n    <span style=\"color:white;\"></span>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote></div><br><br clear=\"all\"><br>-- <br>Moira O&#39;Brien<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.corkphotographer.net\">www.corkphotographer.net</a><br><br>Tel UK:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+44 7831-625990 (UK)<br>Tel Eire&nbsp;&nbsp; +353 876-214532 (Eire)<br>\neFax:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+44 8701-337953<br><br>Personal Website:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.moirajane.net\">www.moirajane.net</a><br>Email:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mailto://mj@...\">mailto://mj@...</a>\n<br>Messengers:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yahoo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moira_ob<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; MSN:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mj@...\">mj@...</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Skype:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MoiraJane<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Googletalk&nbsp;&nbsp;Moirajaneob\n </span></blockquote></div>",
