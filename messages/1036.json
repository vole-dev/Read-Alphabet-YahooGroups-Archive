To be sure,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     there<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     are the outliers on that bell curve who would need to conform<br/>\ntheir<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     speech to a dialect in broader use than their own such as they<br/>\nwould<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     hear on the BBC or from American news outlets. But for most of<br/>\nus, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     doubt we would need spelling police. For example, if I write<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;schedule&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     with a &quot;k&quot; sound, and a Londoner reads it, I seriously doubt, he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     have more than a moment&#39;s hesitation in deciphering the word even<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     though<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     he doesn&#39;t pronounce it that way.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     If we start insisting that every word must be spelt in accordance<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     an arbitrary standard that does not match anyone&#39;s speech<br/>\ncompletely,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     then we will be back to looking up many words and memorizing their<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     spelling. It is my understanding that in Shakespeare&#39;s time,<br/>\nthe idea<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     of proper spelling did not exist, and the Bard was quite<br/>\ncontent to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     spell a word one way today and differently tomorrow. That<br/>\napparently<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     didn&#39;t hold him back We all have been prejudiced by our<br/>\nschooling and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     what Kingsley Read called the &quot;cultural fetish&quot; of spelling to<br/>\nreject<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     the idea that we can spell words the way we want. If we go too far<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     astray, our readers won&#39;t understand, and we pay the price of not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     being<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     read. That by itself, forces a high level of conformism onto the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     situation, but to insist that we all have to spell in lockstep<br/>\nor be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     considered morons is quite a different matter.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     I have seen a number of people insist that we have to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     standardized<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     spelling or we are doomed, but I doubt anyone has actually studied<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     so we have no real data as to how an alternative English alphabet<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     work if it did or did not use standardized spelling. For<br/>\nexample, let<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     us assume that we don&#39;t insist on standardized spelling and that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     it was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     later found that that decision slowed the average reading speed by<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     5 or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     10 % (I doubt it would be any greater than that). Would that<br/>\nnot be a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     reasonable price to pay to avoid putting ourselves back in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     position<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     of attempting to memorize how words should be spelt rather than<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     spelling<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     them the way they sound in speech? I believe it would,<br/>\nespecially for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     the dyslexics among us, who cannot deal with arbitrary spellings.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     If a person occasionally is unsure how to spell a word because he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     suspects he may pronounce it differently than others, he could<br/>\nalways<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     look it up in a dictionary. This is better than trying to memorize<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     spelling of virtually his entire vocabulary in order to have it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     comply<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     with an arbitrary standard of speech.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Paige<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     John Cowan wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; amd64_hacker scripsit:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; Personally I&#39;m for abbreviations in all texts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; It seems to me that since QS is meant to be &#39;heard&#39; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     shouldn&#39;t matter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; how the word is written but how it is read.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; Well, yes, but that slows down reading to the speed of speech. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     suspect<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; that rapid silent reading and standardized orthography go<br/>\ntogether --<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; we do know that fluent readers recognize familiar words by<br/>\nthe total<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; shape of the word, slowing down only when they must to read an<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     unfamilar<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; word, and that this is equally true in languages that are<br/>\nrationally<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; spelled, irrationally spelled, or not spelled at all (like<br/>\nChinese).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; So if QS is going to become important for works meant to be read<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; more than once (as opposed to shorthand/transcription uses), a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; standardized orthography will have to evolve.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; Which immediately leads to the issue of dialects. One&#39;s<br/>\nobvious and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; natural phonetic orthography is another&#39;s stumbling block.<br/>\n(&quot;Hmm,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; is it spelled &#39;theft&#39; or &#39;feft&#39;?&quot; &quot;Hmm, does this mean &#39;lord&#39; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &#39;laud&#39;?&quot;) A universal orthography ends up needing to make more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; distinctions<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; than any one dialect actually needs, and thus to some extent<br/>\nbecoming<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; artificial to all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; John Cowan cowan@... &lt;mailto:cowan%40ccil.org&gt; &lt;mailto:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     cowan% &lt;mailto:cowan%25&gt;40ccil.org &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">http://40ccil.org</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &quot;Mr. Lane, if you ever wish anything that I can do, all you<br/>\nwill have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; to do will be to send me a telegram asking and it will be done.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &quot;Mr. Hearst, if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; anything, you can put the telegram down as a forgery.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",

That\napparently\n&gt; &gt;     didn&#39;t hold him back We all have bee=\r\nn prejudiced by our\nschooling and\n&gt; &gt;     what Kingsley Read called the &quot;cu=\r\nltural fetish&quot; of spelling to\nreject\n&gt; &gt;     the idea that we can spell wor=\r\nds the way we want. If we go too far\n&gt; &gt;     astray, our readers won&#39;t unde=\r\nrstand, and we pay the price of not\n&gt; &gt;     being\n&gt; &gt;     read. That by its=\r\nelf, forces a high level of conformism onto the\n&gt; &gt;     situation, but to i=\r\nnsist that we all have to spell in lockstep\nor be\n&gt; &gt;     considered morons=\r\n is quite a different matter.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     I have seen a number of people in=\r\nsist that we have to have\n&gt; &gt;     standardized\n&gt; &gt;     spelling or we are d=\r\noomed, but I doubt anyone has actually studied\n&gt; &gt;     this\n&gt; &gt;     so we h=\r\nave no real data as to how an alternative English alphabet\n&gt; &gt;     would\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;     work if it did or did not use standardized spelling. For\nexample, let=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;     us assume that we don&#39;t insist on standardized spelling and that\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;     it was\n&gt; &gt;     later found that that decision slowed the average rea=\r\nding speed by\n&gt; &gt;     5 or\n&gt; &gt;     10 % (I doubt it would be any greater th=\r\nan that). Would that\nnot be a\n&gt; &gt;     reasonable price to pay to avoid putt=\r\ning ourselves back in the\n&gt; &gt;     position\n&gt; &gt;     of attempting to memoriz=\r\ne how words should be spelt rather than\n&gt; &gt;     spelling\n&gt; &gt;     them the w=\r\nay they sound in speech? I believe it would,\nespecially for\n&gt; &gt;     the dys=\r\nlexics among us, who cannot deal with arbitrary spellings.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     If a=\r\n person occasionally is unsure how to spell a word because he\n&gt; &gt;     suspe=\r\ncts he may pronounce it differently than others, he could\nalways\n&gt; &gt;     lo=\r\nok it up in a dictionary. This is better than trying to memorize\n&gt; &gt;     th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;     spelling of virtually his entire vocabulary in order to have it\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;     comply\n&gt; &gt;     with an arbitrary standard of speech.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Pai=\r\nge\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     John Cowan wrote:\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; amd64_hacker scripsit:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; Personally I&#39;m for abbreviations in all texts.\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n   &gt; &gt; It seems to me that since QS is meant to be &#39;heard&#39; it\n&gt; &gt;     shoul=\r\ndn&#39;t matter\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; how the word is written but how it is read.\n&gt; &gt;    =\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; Well, yes, but that slows down reading to the speed of speech.=\r\n I\n&gt; &gt;     suspect\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; that rapid silent reading and standardized ort=\r\nhography go\ntogether --\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; we do know that fluent readers recognize =\r\nfamiliar words by\nthe total\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; shape of the word, slowing down only =\r\nwhen they must to read an\n&gt; &gt;     unfamilar\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; word, and that this i=\r\ns equally true in languages that are\nrationally\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; spelled, irration=\r\nally spelled, or not spelled at all (like\nChinese).\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; So =\r\nif QS is going to become important for works meant to be read\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; mor=\r\ne than once (as opposed to shorthand/transcription uses), a\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; stand=\r\nardized orthography will have to evolve.\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; Which immediat=\r\nely leads to the issue of dialects. One&#39;s\nobvious and\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; natural pho=\r\nnetic orthography is another&#39;s stumbling block.\n(&quot;Hmm,\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; is it spel=\r\nled &#39;theft&#39; or &#39;feft&#39;?&quot; &quot;Hmm, does this mean &#39;lord&#39; or\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &#39;laud&#39;?&quot;) =\r\nA universal orthography ends up needing to make more\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; distinctions=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; than any one dialect actually needs, and thus to some extent\nbec=\r\noming\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; artificial to all.\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; --\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; John Co=\r\nwan cowan@... &lt;mailto:cowan%40ccil.org&gt; &lt;mailto:\n&gt; &gt;     cowan% &lt;mailto:cow=\r\nan%25&gt;40ccil.org &lt;http://40ccil.org&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &quot;Mr. Lane, if you ever wish=\r\n anything that I can do, all you\nwill have\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; to do will be to send =\r\nme a telegram asking and it will be done.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &quot;Mr. Hearst, if you ev=\r\ner get a telegram from me asking you to do\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; anything, you can put =\r\nthe telegram down as a forgery.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"
