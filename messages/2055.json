That did not stop publishers from \npublishing books.  I understand times have changed since 1600.  \nNevertheless, the fact that publishers &quot;want&quot; a standardized spelling \nhas more to do with tradition than necessity I expect.  In the last four \ncenturies, the idea that there is a &quot;standard spelling&quot; is now firmly \nentrenched, and we have seen the problems that has caused in English.  \nOnce a spelling is &quot;fixed,&quot; no one has the authority to change it in the \nfuture.  We need to throw out the concept of one correct spelling.  \nOtherwise, I cannot see how we are to continue to modernize our spelling \nto keep pace with the changes in pronunciation.\n\nWhat if publishers edited their authors but did not feel compelled to \nmodify their spelling and accepted that there can be variations from one \ncountry to the next or from one major accent  to another major accent?  \nObviously, most authors are sending their publishers digital versions of \ntheir works these days, rather than typed or penned manuscripts.\n\nAnother issue is involves the changes the publishing industry will \nundergo in the future.  Before long, it may be that books will be \nprinted as the demand calls for them, and the concept of a first \nprinting of a certain number of copies may disappear from the industry \naltogether.  The next step is already appearing.  My wife recently \nbought me a Kindle from Amazon.  It downloads books off the web directly \ninto its memory.  There is no printed form per se.  That being the case, \nwhen QS is adopted, it would be child&#39;s play to print a version in RP or \nGeneral American or General Indian English and let the software handle \nthe spelling conversions from one accent to another.  An e-book user may \nbe given the choice to pick the accent to have he book delivered in with \nno more concern wasted on spelling than I waste worrying whether I will \nbe able to understand an Englishman speaking RP.  In other words -- none.\n\nPaige\n\nJohn Cowan wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; pgabhart scripsit:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I believe you are making a mountain out of a molehill here.
