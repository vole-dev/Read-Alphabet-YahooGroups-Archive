Obviously if we find it reasonable to expect<br/>\npeople who speak &#39;r-dropping&#39; dialects to write all<br/>\nhistorical _r_s in QS then it is just as reasonable to<br/>\nexpect people who speak dialects that merge the three<br/>\nhistorical low back vowels to distinguish these when writing<br/>\nQS -- especially since these dialects are essentially<br/>\ncomplementary: *everyone* from both major dialect groups<br/>\nwill have to make some effort to preserve in spelling some<br/>\ndistinctions lost in their own speech but preserved in the<br/>\nother major dialect group.

The problem<br/>\nwith traditional English orthography is that it is far too<br/>\nconservative, reflecting the pronunciation of half a<br/>\nmillennium ago.
