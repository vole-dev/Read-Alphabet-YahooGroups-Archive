Thanks, John, for the history lesson.\n\nI was thinking of Henry the VIII&#39;s reign and the lack of standardization \nat that time.  You are suggesting that the standards had firmed up \nconsiderably in the latter part of the 16th century.  Was the chaos of \nprivate spelling, as you refer to it, difficult to comprehend, or did it \njust slow reading down because one was forced to decipher unusually \nspelled words too frequently?\n\nIt makes sense that professional scribes would tend toward \nstandardization.  Since they spent their working lives writing, they \nwould be likely to develop spellings that were consistent over time.  Of \ncourse, I would suspect that a large part of the spelling \ninconsistencies prior to this had to do with the poor fit between the \nRoman alphabet and English phonemes.  It would not be possible to spell \nwords in so many different ways if the alphabet fit English better as QS \ndoes. \n\nThe bare statement that the official Dutch orthography changes every few \ndecades implies that some organization with authority makes that \nchange.  What is that organization?  The Dutch government?  A language \nacademy?  It appears to me that standardized does mean &quot;fixed&quot; in \nEnglish because there is no authority to force a change on a language \nspoken around the world.\n\nI am not advocating anarchy in spelling -- just some freedom for \nindividuality.  I believe that the percentage of words which people \nwould spell differently would be relatively limited and would not \ngreatly impede readability.\n\nPaige\n\nP.S.  Moira, thanks for your input.\n\nJohn Cowan wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; pgabhart scripsit:\n&gt; &gt; When Shakespeare was penning his plays, I believe standardized spelling\n&gt; &gt; was a concept that did not exist.\n&gt;\n&gt; It most definitely did.
