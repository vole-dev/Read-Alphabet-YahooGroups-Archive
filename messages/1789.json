As you know they are based on the general australian <br/>\naccent and pronunciations.  Since you are american, I&#39;m curious to <br/>\nknow how challenging you found it read them. <br/>\nBecause I designed them for australians to read and learn rapidly, I <br/>\ndeliberately left out the post-vocalic Rs.  Please note that when <br/>\nyou write quikscript you should include all the TO Rs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo me it makes sense that everybody learns two QS versions, one that <br/>\nfollows their own accent (well not exactly their own, but rather <br/>\nthey choose a specific dictionary to use) and then one standardised <br/>\ninternational version.  I&#39;m waiting to see if this group will settle <br/>\non such a standard thats handles sound mergers and the like.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we do agree on a standard for international spelling then I would <br/>\nlike to follow up the Alice tutorials with a set of tutorials based <br/>\non the Lewis Carroll book &#39;Through the Looking Glass&#39;. These <br/>\ntutorials would use the first few chapters of the book to transition <br/>\nfrom the Australian accent to the standard and the rest of the book <br/>\nwould be reading practice for the standard.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: I would like to produce a general american version of the Alice <br/>\ntutes, but unfortunately I don&#39;t have the time nor enough experience <br/>\nwith the american accent and pronunciations.       \u00e9</div>",
