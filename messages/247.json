Is anyone proficient enough to\n&gt;record conversations on the street?  I just as soon prefer not to\nlearn Pitman shorthand.\n\n\n\n  Your question has several interpretations.\n\n1) Can you use QS for taking dictation?\n\nI think you can. In fact, your question has inspired me to change my \ntraining strategy from just transliterating texts, to taking \ndictation.  I now record several paragraphs of the text on my pocket \nrecorder and play it back while writing QS.  (At first you&#39;d think \nknowing the text up front is cheating - but believe me, there is \nstill plenty to learn by this process.) Also one begins to grasp \nwhole words in QS, as opposed to linking sounds like pearls on a \nstring.\n\n2) Can you take down people&#39;s accents, as Professor Higgins did in My \nFair Lady?\n\nI say no.  Higgins was using Bell&#39;s Visible Speech, which recognized \nmany more phonemes than the 40 allotted to QS.  Today he would use \nIPA.\n\nPitman, as I understand it, is not a phoneme-based shorthand, but \nmerely a means of taking dictation, an art that, anyway, was made \nobolete by the Dictaphone.\n\nShaw did all of his writing in Pittman (which probably accounts for \nthe long-winded, oratorical prose style he was prone to), and he had \na noble secretary who transcribed all his drafts into good old Roman \ntypewriting.  One of Shaw&#39;s goals in commissioning Shavian was to \nmake a system easier to learn than Pittman, as well as one based on \ngood phonemics. He was happy to leave the recording of accents and \nspeech variations to the experts.\n\n\n-- \n- /bob /mk/brMm\n   /wUdstak  /nV /jDk\n\n&quot;@un simbel iL az gUd Az anuHD prOvFdeB\n  evrI@an ataceL H sEm mIGiN tM it.&quot;\n                    - /JPJ /bxGRB /SY\r\n--============_-1178549713==_ma============\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;\r\n\r\n&lt;!doctype html public &quot;-//W3C//DTD W3 HTML//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!--\nblockquote, dl, ul, ol, li { margin-top: 0 ; margin-bottom: 0 }\n --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;title&gt;[Read_Alphabet] Re: New member:\nRead_Alphabet&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;blockquote type=&quot;cite&quot; cite&gt;&lt;tt&gt;I&#39;d like to ask everyone in this\ngroup if they find QS to be&lt;br&gt;\npractical for transcribing speech.&nbsp; Is anyone proficient enough\nto&lt;br&gt;\nrecord conversations on the street?&nbsp; I just as soon prefer not\nto&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;tt&gt;learn Pitman shorthand.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/tt&gt;Your question has several interpretations.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;1) Can you use QS for taking dictation?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I think you can.
