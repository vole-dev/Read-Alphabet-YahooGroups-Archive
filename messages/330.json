I also know that this is <br/>\na forum for the read alphabet, so I&#39;ll be keeping my clearscript <br/>\ncorrespondance to email from here on out, but there are some general <br/>\nthings that I wanted to bring to light here.<br/>\n<br/>\n------<br/>\n<br/>\nI still think the vowels should be moved to the writing line.

These are because descenders tend to <br/>\nclutter, clump and generally make unreadable whatever is directly <br/>\nbelow them.  You will also note that, in response to this, the <br/>\ndescenders we DO have are comparatively simple and uncluttered; they <br/>\nare straight and thin or slightly curved and thin. In your scheme, <br/>\nyou will have large portions of characters resting below the writing <br/>\nline, and this will virtually necessitate a double-spaced and <br/>\ninefficient format.   Other languages have solved (or never <br/>\nencountered) the problem of descenders by simply making one square <br/>\nwriting line (Chinese, Japanese, Korean for instance).  I would <br/>\nsuggest the same to you.  Once again, I would argue that most people <br/>\ndo not really make the IPA distinctions (in this case between voiced <br/>\nand unvoiced).

Those exceptions to pairs <br/>\ncould start anywhere else.  These are of course just random ideas to <br/>\nlet you know directions you could take.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally think it would be fine without such distinctions aside <br/>\nfrom the inverting.  When creating a new alphabet, it is often easy <br/>\nto err on the side of either mnemonics, readability or writing speed, <br/>\nwhilst throwing one or both of the others out of balance.  In the <br/>\ncase of quickscript, for instance, I believe it is imbalanced <br/>\nslightly on the side writing speed against mnemonics and <br/>\nreadability.  Now, I know I&#39;ll probably catch some flak for saying <br/>\nthat here, but it&#39;s true.  This is not to say that Quickscript needs <br/>\nto be changed.  Far from it.  In fact, I still love it.  I&#39;m just <br/>\npointing out some things for perspective.
