  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-292415964\">Hi Paul,<br><br>Excellent question!<br><br>In both situations I prefer the double-size letters. The QS manual simply says,<br><br>&quot;Shorts and Talls stand on the same level of the &#39;writing-line&#39; and keep it clearly defined. Shorts and Deeps rise to the same level of the &#39;upper parallel&#39; keeping that also well defined.&quot;\n<br><br>I&#39;ve just taken a ruler to a copy of the manual. On the page where the alphabet is introduced, the distance between the dots (indicating the height of the Shorts) is 4 mm. There is some variation in the heights of the Talls, but mostly they are around 8 mm in height. The Deeps are more consistent, dropping 4 mm below the writing line in almost every case.\n<br><br>I believe this is also consistent with traditional cursive writing.<br><br>If followed strictly, there is the potential for occasional contact between a Deep and a Tall on the next line, so I understand the idea of using a slightly different ratio. I&#39;d suggest something like \n1.8, though, instead of 1.5 for the medium size.<br><br>Ted<br><br><br><div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-292415964gmail_quote\">On 10/9/07, <b class=\"ygrps-yiv-292415964gmail_sendername\">Paul Tremblay</b> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:phthenry@...\">phthenry@...</a>\n&gt; wrote:</span><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-292415964gmail_quote\" style=\"border-left:1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n\n\n<div style=\"width:655px;\">\n  <div style=\"padding:0pt 15px 0pt 0pt;width:490px;float:left;\">\n\n\n    <div>\n            <p>Hi group,<br>\n<br>\nI&#39;m trying to determine how much larger the tall and deep letters are<br>\nthan the small letters. It seems that the Read manual makes the large<br>\nletters double that of the smaller ones, but I&#39;m not sure. To test<br>\nthis out, I make two large representations of the letters, one in<br>\nwhich the large letters are about 1 1/2 times larger than the small<br>\nones, and one in which the large ones are a full double size.<br>\n<br>\nI&#39;d appreciate as much feedback as possible to these two questions:<br>\n<br>\n1. Which proportion looks the best in an ideal situation--where you<br>\ndidn&#39;t have to worry about space, for example when you are doing art<br>\nwork on a wall or doing calligraphy.<br>\n<br>\n2. Which proportion looks better in writing? Let&#39;s pretend that you<br>\nhave a nice large sheet in front of you and you know that you are<br>\ngoing to have to have a lot of line space for the larger letters, but<br>\ntighter space for the smaller ones.<br>\n<br>\nThanks!<br>\n<br>\nPaul<br>\n</p>\n    </div>  \n\n    \n    <span style=\"color:white;\"></span>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br clear=\"all\"></div></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><br>\n</div>",
