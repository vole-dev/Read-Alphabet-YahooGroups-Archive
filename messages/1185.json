  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1575347211\">Maybe for the benefit of beginners and our own discourse, we should<br/>\npost a rough IPA mapping right away maybe with the caveat that the<br/>\ncharacters are actually phonemic (ie each character represents a suite<br/>\nof sounds of which the one listed is prominent). If mine is an<br/>\nacceptable first pass then let&#39;s put it up and if it&#39;s way off then<br/>\nsomeone please let me know so I can correct myself.<br/>\n   In building such a rough map I would have two humble suggestions:<br/>\n   1. That Kingsley Read was intelligent and well informed thus, at least<br/>\nto him if not me, the examples in QM are consistent.<br/>\n   2. That Read was using a accent widely distributed in the middle<br/>\n20th century. He refers to &quot;the majority of English speakers&quot; and<br/>\nwhile today I suspect &quot;the&quot; American accent is now that of the<br/>\nmajority, I intuit Read was effectively referring to BBC English. He<br/>\nalso refers to &quot;George V&quot; but crawling over tapes of him to find how<br/>\nhe pronounced &quot;j&#39;ai&quot; is impractical (and a personal anathema to a<br/>\nnative son of George Washington&#39;s country ;-) while flipping through<br/>\nthe Oxford unabridged to look up 40 words is pretty simple.<br/>\n<br/>\n  After this is done, maybe we could put up multiple example sounds of<br/>\neach letter from several accents which clearly state the speakers<br/>\norigin and note when a particular accent does not use a particular<br/>\nsound (group). This latter step would probably be very useful to<br/>\nbeginners with only a cursory knowledge of linguistics who want to get<br/>\nup and running quickly or people whose agenda may not require highly<br/>\ndetailed knowledge of pronunciation. But I think we need at least an<br/>\nagreement on a rough IPA map before we could venture toward examples.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Finally, explicitly mentioning some issues frequently faced by<br/>\ncertain classes of speakers (eg the &quot;ahh&quot; vs &quot;awe&quot; melding) could help<br/>\nbeginners and those who do not want to spend vast tracks of time<br/>\nguessing at pronunciation when they are coming to QS with other tasks<br/>\nin mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Personally I will greatly enjoy a detailed conversation about the<br/>\nprecise sound or set of sounds of each letter. Indeed the result of<br/>\nsuch a study might have mind boggling benefits: for example it might<br/>\nallow us to transcribe Milton or Shakespeare et al into the original<br/>\naccent easily approached by anyone knowing QS. But such a conversation<br/>\ncould easily go on for quite some time and still not have an agreed<br/>\nconclusion while persons new to the language can not even start<br/>\nwithout waves of self doubt. So in my humble opinion, posting a rough<br/>\nIPA approximation in the interim would be highly desirable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a>, John Cowan &lt;cowan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ph.
