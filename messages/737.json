Whenever you<br/>\nwrite something informal (ie notes only to yourself), substitute the<br/>\nwords, &quot;be, and, of, for, to, it, is & the&quot; for their 1-letter<br/>\nequivalents in Quikscript.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone learns differently.

From what I&#39;m seeing, it<br/>\n&gt; seems to work for two sounds, a soft &#39;i&#39; as in &#39;pit&#39; (or the u sound<br/>\n&gt; in busy) as well as a long &#39;ee&#39; as in &#39;see&#39; (or the y sound in busy)<br/>\n&gt; and you are supposed to use No. 26 for the &#39;ee&#39; sound made at the end<br/>\n&gt; of words that end in &#39;y&#39; such as busy? Is that correct? Does that mean<br/>\n&gt; you would write &#39;pity&#39; as 1-26-3-26 as opposed to 1-26-3-27? Why not<br/>\n&gt; just use No. 27 EA-t which already represents this sound? Also, if No.<br/>\n&gt; 26 applies to &#39;ee&#39; ending sound words that end in &#39;y&#39; such as &#39;lovely&#39;<br/>\n&gt; or &#39;money&#39; does it apply to words that end in &#39;ie&#39; but have the same<br/>\n&gt; sound, such as &#39;aerie&#39; or &#39;freebie&#39;? I&#39;m guessing as QT is based on<br/>\n&gt; pronunciation, not spelling, it would. Still, I don&#39;t get 26 instead<br/>\n&gt; of 27.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For Senior Quikscript, #26 is used at the end of a word when it is a<br/>\nnon-stressed &quot;-y&quot; (such as &quot;city&quot;) sound.
