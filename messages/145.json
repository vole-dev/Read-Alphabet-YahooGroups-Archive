I don&#39;t\nremember if he mentioned how he decided on the name &quot;Jerome.&quot;\n\nWhen I stumbled across the Shavian site by chance one day, almost\nimmediately I began writing about Quikscript and asked whether anyone\nhad ever created a QS font since I could not read Shavian fluently.  (I\nonly used Shavian for about 3 months before Kingsley Read wrote in\nresponse to my letter and told me about QS and sent me a copy of his\nmanual.) The response  on the Shavian site was that no one had designed\na QS font as more people were aware of Shavian than of QS due to the\nprinting of Androcles and the Lion in Shavian and Roman.\n\nSince I knew nothing about font creation at the time, I asked if anyone\nwould be willing to create a QS font so that those of us interested in\nQS could communicate on the net.  I recieved what I can only\ncharacterize as a tepid response.  One person opined they might create a\nQS font at some indefinite time in the future if they could get around\nto it.\n\nWhen Jon came on the Shavian site, he became interested in QS very\nquickly, and set about correcting the lack of a QS font.  As you may\nhave noticed, Jerome is not perfect, but as it was Jon&#39;s first effort at\nfont creation, I think it is excellent under the circumstances.\n\nThere is no authority governing font creation for QS anymore than there\nis for the roman alphabet.  If someone wants to create another QS font,\nthey are free to do so.  If its appearance is appealing and it works\nwell, then it is likely that people will use it.  Anyone who is a member\nof Read_Alphabet can post a font for a trial if they choose to.  If a\nfont is produced that works better than Jerome, then people would\nprobably shift to it.\n\nBy the way, due to the conncection between Shavian and QS, Jon chose to\nuse the Shavian keyboard mapping for Jerome.  I don&#39;t know how that\nmapping first came about, but in my opinion it is not easy to learn.  It\nmight be different if one were not starting from knowledge of the roman\nalphabet, but I don&#39;t think there is anyone out there that is not coming\nfrom a roman background!  Therefore, (with the help of Ewout Stam\npointing me to Keyman, which makes it possible) and with much assistance\nfrom Jon, I recently completed a new mapping for Jerome that, to my\nmind, is much easier to use in making the transition from roman to QS.\nAdditionally, it permits the full use of the QS half-letters  and\nalternative letter forms (which Shavian does not use) and the\nligatures.  The actual mapping is still the old Shavian mapping, but\nKeyman produces what might be called an interpreter that translates your\nkey strokes to the output needed for the actual Jerome mapping.  Keyman\n3.2 is available through the Tavultesoft.com site.  The other files\nneeded to make this work are on the Read_Alphabet site.  They are either\nin the font or resources section.  Try them out and I believe you will\nfind them much easier than the Shavian mapping.  Good luck.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nPaige Gabhart\n\njeff_smith_8992 wrote:\n\n&gt;  I have some (hopefully) quick questions about the Jerome font...\n&gt; their real intent is to try to get a better understanding of how\n&gt; stable or changeable the Jerome font is.\n&gt;\n&gt; In looking through the past message posts to this group, it appears\n&gt; that Jon Zuck completed his work on Jerome back in December of 2000.\n&gt; Did he actually create Jerome?
