It is my understanding this is the most common sound in English.  I <br/>\nhave been using Quikscript for 25 years.

I&#39;ve been talking about <br/>\nQuikscript on and off on the Shavian site for almost a year, but I have <br/>\nreceived little feedback regarding Quikscript, and I guess Richmond found <br/>\nno need to change the text of his website even though I wrote about my <br/>\nexperiences with QS.  I had no experience with fonts, and until Jon Zuck <br/>\ncame along and put Jerome together, everyone pretty much ignored my <br/>\ncomments.  I assume two reasons account for this:  most of them did not <br/>\nknow anything about QS, and they had already spent some time and effort on <br/>\nShavian, and really did not want to hear that Reed had improved it after <br/>\nextensive testing.

The shift-tilda gets you a <br/>\nhalf-Wheat, which along with a half-Yo, is a letter I have used for a <br/>\nnumber of years.  Read did not actually include it in his QS manual, but I <br/>\nsaw no reason not to use it in handwriting as he suggested in the other <br/>\nhalf-letters as it is just as legible as they are, which is to say, perfectly.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding your comments on the use of this letter. I have not studied the <br/>\nhistory of linguistic change, but my assumption is that this sound was the <br/>\nnorm at one time, and that the people who now think it is archaic because <br/>\nthey do not happen to use it are speakers of dialects which have moved away <br/>\nfrom it.  I grew up and have lived in the states of Kentucky and southern <br/>\nIndiana all my life.
