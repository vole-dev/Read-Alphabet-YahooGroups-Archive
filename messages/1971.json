  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-906535136\">It seems to me that some, though perhaps not all, aspects of Senior QS<br/>\ncould serve as an aid to reading a long text. Consider the word &quot;end&quot;.<br/>\nNot only is it a common word, but it comprises a letter sequence that<br/>\noccurs frequently in the beginning, middle and end of longer words<br/>\n(e.g. endurance, commendable, trend). As I have argued before, a word<br/>\nsuch as &quot;end&quot; would look quite strange if written with #23 instead of<br/>\nalt-#23, and I further contend that the alternates for #23 and #36<br/>\nshould be included in Junior QS. So the proper spelling (using revised<br/>\nnames) would be Ed+Noon+Deed. Now, once you begin to use half-letters,<br/>\nit becomes immediately natural to use half-Deed in &quot;end&quot;:<br/>\nEd+Noon+half-Deed.
