  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-379293694\">To thousandshipz:<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the Read_Alphabet group.  I just read your post on the<br/>\nShavian group.  I found it interesting, especially the comment regarding<br/>\nthe Japanese using more than one alphabet.  How relevant that is to<br/>\nwriting English, however, is another question.  I do not know the<br/>\nhistory behind the different Japanese writing systems -- when, why and<br/>\nhow they were developed.  I assume it was a natural, evolutionary<br/>\nprocess, and not an alternative design by one individual who was seeking<br/>\nan improved writing system as Quikscript was.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also appreciated your comment regarding QS.  One of the reasons I<br/>\nstarted the Read_Alphabet site was because I got so frustrated with the<br/>\nShavian group.  They seem devoted to discussing minutae of the Shavian<br/>\nalphabet ad infinitum:  which pronunciation should we use, RP or NBC<br/>\nEnglish, what order should the alphabet letters be in, how should the<br/>\nkeyboard be mapped, should characters be allowed to have more than one<br/>\npronunciation to allow different dialects to share the same spelling,<br/>\netc.,etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first stumbled across Shavian, I wrote Kingsley Read in the early<br/>\nto mid-seventies.  He wrote back and sent me a copy of the QS manual.<br/>\nHe described QS as the improved version of Shavian.  Naturally, once I<br/>\nlearned he revised the Shavian alphabet in ways which he felt made it<br/>\nbetter, it made sense to me to shift to QS from Shavian.  The thought of<br/>\ncontinuing to use Shavian, when its author had abandoned it, never<br/>\noccurred to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is why I have found it so difficult to understand the philosophy<br/>\ndriving the Shavian group.  Most of them, perhaps all, know that QS<br/>\nexists, but they prefer to continue using the Beta model of the<br/>\nalphabet.  When I questioned this position, the answer given was that<br/>\nthe publication of Androcles and the Lion in Shavian had made so many<br/>\nmore people aware of Shavian in comparison to QS that they continued to<br/>\nfoster its adoption rather than QS.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is nonsensical to me.  Out of several hundred million English<br/>\nspeakers, only a few thousand have even heard of Shavian and, probably<br/>\nonly a few hundred have tried writing it.  This is, literally, the<br/>\nproverbial drop in the bucket.  It is not as if we have a big ground<br/>\nswell of people already favoring Shavian.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost adults use the curvise roman alphabet when they write by hand.  QS<br/>\nhas a more cursive appearance than Shavian and avoids its mandatory<br/>\npen-lifts between every letter.  In other words, it is more similar in<br/>\nthose two characteristics to the roman alphabet than Shavian is.  The<br/>\npen-lifts make Shavian slower to write than QS and the letters,<br/>\nespecially the diphthongs, are more difficult to write correctly.<br/>\nDespite Quikscript&#39;s initial unfamiliarity, I believe the features it<br/>\nhas in common with the roman alphabet would give it an advantage for its<br/>\nadoption as an alternative alphabet in comparison to Shavian.
