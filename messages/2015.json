  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1063309082\">A little info for you about Alice--  It was designed mainly for <br/>\nAustralians to learn quikscript easily, but it glad to hear that you <br/>\ncan still benefit from it.  These tutorials are really just <br/>\nintroduction tutes, designed to get you started in being able to read <br/>\nquikscript, but it requires alot more reading to become truely fluent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI deliberately left out the rhotic &#39;r&#39; to speed learning for <br/>\nAustralians.<br/>\n<br/>\nI considered it best that people learn quikscript by basically learning <br/>\ntwo versions-- first one based on their own pronunciations and then <br/>\nproper international quikscript.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had planned to write a follow up tutorial which uses the <br/>\nbook &quot;Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There&quot; which <br/>\nstarts where the Alice tutes finished and uses the first half of the <br/>\nbook to adapt Austrlian junior quikscript to an international junior <br/>\nquikscript.  The last half of the book would be purely for practise of <br/>\nthe international version. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that we don&#39;t have an agreed upon international version. <br/>\nThis was discussed quite a bit a long time ago-- the main issues is <br/>\nwhat to do with mergers and splits of some accents, particularly the <br/>\ndifferences between the UK accents and the American accents.  (eg: the <br/>\ncaught/cot merger in General American).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think most would agree that RP could be used as a standard for UK <br/>\nEnglish, cause most Britians know what it sounds like and can imagine <br/>\nhow to write it.  Also most other native English speakers in the <br/>\nEnglish Commonwealth (except possibly Canada) can also phonemicly <br/>\nemulate RP easily (eg: at the phonemic level there is hardly any <br/>\ndifference between RP, Australian and New Zealand-- South African might <br/>\nbe considered to have a few minor splits though not overly different. I <br/>\nimagine that most Indians who speak English would be close to RP at the <br/>\nphonemic level-- though not sure of this.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do support the idea that a true international quickscript should <br/>\ninclude the rhotic &#39;r&#39; though it is a little difficult for us non-<br/>\nrhotic speakers to know where to put them but not overly so.  This <br/>\ndifficulty is probably not as great as that faced by a General American <br/>\nwhen trying to decided where to use &#39;Ox&#39;, &#39;Ah&#39; and &#39;Awe&#39; when emulating <br/>\nRP english.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Could be please inform me of any mistakes/typos in the Alices <br/>\ntutorials you find while you are reading them :)</div>",
