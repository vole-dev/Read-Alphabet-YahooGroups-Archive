Here are some examples of this:\n\nIn lesson 2 (no. 27) the vowel (Eat) is improperly shapedj .  The second \nstroke should be vertical, not slanted.  I am not sure what font the \nauthor used for these lessons although I remember seeing it before.  In \nsome words in memrise, the letter &quot;eat&quot; is formed correctly, in other \nplaces,  the author used this improperly shaped form.  Obviously, you \ndon&#39;t want the shape of &quot;eat&quot; to flip back and forth since you are \ntrying to build a connection in your mind between the letter shape and \nthe sound.\n\nLesson 4 - the word &quot;anger&quot; is misspelled.  The initial vowel should be \n&quot;at&quot; followed by &quot;ing, not &quot;no&quot;.  The next word &quot;hunger&quot; is also \nmisspelled.  &quot;No&quot; is used instead of &quot;ing&quot; once again. The next word \n&quot;singing&quot; is also mispelled.  We have &quot;ing&quot; at the end of the word, but \nit is missing in the middle where again he uses &quot;no&quot;.  The next word is \n&quot;anchor.&quot;  Again we need &quot;ing&quot; and the author uses &quot;no.&quot;  It seems \nevident he does not understand when &quot;ing&quot; is required.\n\nI don&#39;t have time to continue looking for mistakes but based on what I \nhave seen so far, I would be very cautious about using memrise as a \nsource for accurate information on learning QS.  For a beginner, it \nwould be hard to recognize what is correct and what is not.\n\nI would suggest that you download the QS manual from the Read Alphabet \nsite (qs manual modern (beta), which was written by Kingsley Read, so \nyou can see the proper form of all the letters and study the writing \nexamples which it contains.  Once you have done that, the mistakes in \nmemrise should be more obvious to you.\n\nGood luck.\n\nPaige\n\n\nOn 7/10/2017 8:27 PM, tvindy@...
