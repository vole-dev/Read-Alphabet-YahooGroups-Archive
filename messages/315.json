I don&#39;t ascribe it to any flaw in the alphabet, however.  I have \nnot tried to learn another alphabet, such as Greek or Cyrillic, as an \nadult so it is difficult to judge whether the problem could be connected \nto the fact that most of us are introduced to our language&#39;s writing \nsystem when quite young and, possibly, a child&#39;s mind is more malleable \nthan an adult&#39;s, as is evidenced by children&#39;s alleged ease in learning \nlanguage.  \n\nBut I believe it more likely that the heart of the problem lies in the \nlimited amount of practice we get in reading QS.  From our birth we are \nsurrounded by the ubiquity of the roman alphabet.  It is everywhere, and \nwe see it constantly.  Our facility in reading it is so great that we \nread and comprehend the meaning even when we have no desire to, such as \nadvertising on the side of a bus. QS is not ubiquitous.  Most of us \nusing it primarily see our own QS rather than other people&#39;s.  If the \npeople on this list communicated in QS, at least part of the time, I \nbelieve we would see an improvement in our ability to read QS.\n\nWe write one symbol at a time so it is easy to spell by sound in QS as \nwe go.  However, we read in larger chunks, words at the minimum, or \nseveral words in a glance, if we are to read with any speed.  Obviously, \nthe connection in the brain between the symbol and the sound must be one \nhundred percent solid so that no conscious thought is required. \n Apparently, this takes lots of practice -- considerably more than most \nof us have given QS.  Think of the years you have spent reading TO \nbefore you conclude that QS is in some way deficient.\n\nI am more proficient at reading QS now than I was in the past since I \nhave spent more time at it recently, but it is still not as automatic as \nreading the traditional orthography (TO).  I almost feel as if I have to \nshift gears when I read it. But I am finding that I read whole words and \nmore now than I used to since I started writing more in it.  I write \nnotes in QS in my files and sometimes intersperse it with TO.  I have \nmentioned to my secretary that she should learn to read it, but she \nhasn&#39;t found the time yet.  My law partner (my father) has expressed \nsome annoyment at my use of QS, which he expresses by noting &quot;if you get \nhit by a truck, I won&#39;t be able to read these notes in your files.&quot;  I \nwill have to convince my secretary to learn QS.  After all, they all \nused to learn shorthand and didn&#39;t complain.  Once she can read it, she \ncan transliterate it for my father if the proverbial truck with my name \non it appears.\n\n \n\nPaige Gabhart\n\n\n\nmitchell perilstein wrote:\n\n&gt;On Fri, 2003-05-30 at 14:29, Robert McBroom wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I agree that, for me too, QS has proven a write-only language.
