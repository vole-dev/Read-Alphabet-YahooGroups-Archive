I like the way you number the additions <br/>\nsuch as Loch.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we are trying to make the alphabet smaller, then we might consider <br/>\ngetting rid of both Loch and LLan. If I am correct, these letters are <br/>\nmeant to express sounds in Scotish and Irish English, but our new <br/>\nconcept of lexical sets no longer thinks of the Read alphabet as a <br/>\nphonetic alphabet. I believe other letters will serve for these two. If <br/>\nwe give Scotts their own letter, why shouldn&#39;t we give Australian 4 or 5 <br/>\nof their own letters, since many of their vowels correspond to any Read <br/>\nletter? This is just a suggestion. I&#39;m not really attached to this <br/>\nposition, but only bring it up because we are concerned about making the <br/>\nalphabet too big and really an alternative Ado might serve us better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there was reason that Read got rid of the two forms of Utter in <br/>\nhis original alphabet. I think the reason was that no one could <br/>\ndistinguish between the two? I know that I would have a hard time in <br/>\nmany cases. However, I think you are suggesting that we use the <br/>\nalternate form of Ado discriminately, only before Roar, for example?<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like the ligature Error and I think I&#39;ll include that in my font. <br/>\n  Regarding which ligatures to include, that is something I have also <br/>\nthought about. If we include Earth, why not the others? Reading the news <br/>\ntoday in occurred to me that there are other words which contain two <br/>\nvowels followed by Roar, but these combinations did not confuse me. I <br/>\nguess it comes down to how confusing ceratain combinations are. As I get <br/>\nmore experienced reading QS, will I be able to sort out Ado Roar Ed with <br/>\nthe same ease I sort out other letters? I can&#39;t tell at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul</div>",
