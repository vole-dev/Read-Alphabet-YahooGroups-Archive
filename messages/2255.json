A book I have lists the phoneme inventories<br/>\nof a lot of languages, and for Dutch it gives just the<br/>\n15 vowel phonemes of your primary list, which I have<br/>\ntentatively mapped to QS letters above. It also says<br/>\nthat funny things happen with vowels before /r/, and<br/>\nmost of your &#39;extra&#39; vowels/allophones fit into that<br/>\ndescription. (That&#39;s not unusual BTW: look at the havoc<br/>\n/r/ after vowels wrought on English for example -- just<br/>\ncompare the spelling and the modern pronunciation!<br/>\nIt also says that /E: \u0153: O:/ and nasalized vowels<br/>\noccur marginally in French loan words, but since<br/>\nthey are marginal I see no reason not to write them with<br/>\nthe same letters as their short counterparts, and with<br/>\nthe letters for the corresponding non-nasalized vowels<br/>\n+ #21 or + #23.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso it is probably a good idea when adapting QS to a<br/>\nlanguage which, like Dutch and Swedish, but unlike<br/>\nEnglish, still has a more or less &#39;sane&#39; Latin letter<br/>\northography, to go for a systematic and simple mapping<br/>\nbetween Latin letter spellings and QS letters. All those<br/>\nallophones, like similar delinquents in Swedish BTW,<br/>\ndon&#39;t have their own spellings, which probably means that<br/>\nspeakers/writers of an overall &#39;sanely&#39; written language,<br/>\nwhere in the overwhelming majority of cases the pronunciation can<br/>\nbe derived from the spelling by straightforward rules,<br/>\nwill have a hard time sorting out those allophones and<br/>\nmarginal phonemes which share a spelling with some similar<br/>\nsound. It&#39;s simply overkill to attempt to spell them<br/>\ndistinctively -- and it&#39;s probably mostly overkill to<br/>\ndistinguish /\u00e6/ and /A/ in English too, BTW.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the consonants the biggest issue is of course<br/>\nhow to write /x/ and /G/. I&#39;d suggest a radical<br/>\nsolution: reassign #7 to /x/ and #8 to /G/, using the<br/>\nsymbols for an English pair of phonemes which don&#39;t<br/>\noccur in Dutch for a Dutch pair of phonemes which<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t occur in English. This way you also get a very<br/>\nattractive ligature #11+#7 for /sx/. If you feel a need<br/>\nto write the English &#39;th&#39; sounds with a separate<br/>\nletter, rather than replacing them with /t/d/ or /s/z/<br/>\nor whatever they get replaced with when adapting<br/>\nEnglish words to Dutch phonology. you can use the loCH<br/>\nletter for them -- even turn it upside down if you want<br/>\nto distinguish [D] from [T], even though the functional<br/>\nload of the /T/~/D/ distinction in English is rather<br/>\nlow, and will be even lower in the range of loans into<br/>\nDutch. (We have the same problem in Swedish: /T/, but<br/>\n/D/ much less so, is on its way to become a<br/>\nloan-phoneme in Swedish for a few speakers, but most<br/>\nreplace English /T/ with /t/, and practically everyone<br/>\nreplaces /D/ with /d/.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\n/bpj<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Best regards, Pieter (pronounced /pit@r/)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; CONSONANTS FREQUENCIES There is a number of remarkable<br/>\n&gt; differences is consonant frequencies that I think should be<br/>\n&gt; taken into consideration.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *   Dutch completely lacks the English /T/, /D/ and // w(#7<br/>\n&gt;     and #8).<br/>\n&gt; *   The phonemes /g/, /S/, /tS/, and /dZ/ (#6, #13, #15<br/>\n&gt;     and #16), while common in English, are rare in Dutch,<br/>\n&gt;     occuring almost exclusively in loanwords, as in &quot;goal&quot;,<br/>\n&gt;     &quot;shock&quot;, &quot;check&quot; and &quot;gel&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; *   The phoneme /Z/ (#14) seems to be rare in both<br/>\n&gt;     languages. In Dutch it only occurs in loanwords, like<br/>\n&gt;     &quot;journaal&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; *   English completely lacks phonemes /G/ and /x/ (which are<br/>\n&gt;     very common in Dutch and make us sound like Klingons.<br/>\n&gt;     Read invented the letter &quot;lo-CH&quot; to be able to write<br/>\n&gt;     Scottish names, but given the high frequency of /G/ and<br/>\n&gt;     /x/ in Dutch I suggest a more versatile character be<br/>\n&gt;     used.<br/>\n&gt; *   The &quot;lo-CH&quot; letter always starts &quot;tall&quot; and ends on the<br/>\n&gt;     lower parallel, which would cause frequent penlifts for<br/>\n&gt;     Dutch writers.<br/>\n&gt; *   /G/ is most frequently preceded by /@/ and /OU/, and<br/>\n&gt;     followed by /@/, /r/, /eI/ and /I/.<br/>\n&gt; *   /x/ is most frequently preceded by /A/, /E/ and /s/ (eg.<br/>\n&gt;     in the infamous word &quot;Scheveningen&quot;), and followed by a<br/>\n&gt;     /t/ or /r/. The combination /sxr/ (as in &quot;schrijven&quot;) is<br/>\n&gt;     particularly frequent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; CONSONANT USE In Dutch, consonants at the end of a word are<br/>\n&gt; (almost) always voiceless, even if they stem from (and are<br/>\n&gt; written as) a voiced consonant. For example: &quot;bod&quot; /bOt/,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;eb&quot; /Ep/, &quot;maag&quot; /ma:x/. In English, voiced consonants at<br/>\n&gt; word endings are common, as in &quot;stub&quot;, &quot;naked&quot; (and many<br/>\n&gt; other words ending with &quot;-ed&quot;), &quot;dig&quot;, &quot;love&quot;, &quot;was&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;page&quot;. This remarkable difference could be taken into<br/>\n&gt; consideration. Eg. Read designed is alphabet such that<br/>\n&gt; voiced consonants /b/, /d/ and /z/ are particularly easy to<br/>\n&gt; write at word endings, using the alternative character for<br/>\n&gt; #2, #4 and #12 respectively. Note particularly the plural<br/>\n&gt; /z/ at the end of many English plurals, eg. &quot;berries&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; VOWELS In consonants, there&#39;s enough overlap between Dutch<br/>\n&gt; and English to make QuickScript suitable for Dutch without<br/>\n&gt; major changes. consonants, so Dutch has a lot more vowels<br/>\n&gt; than English. Many of the vowels in English do not occur in<br/>\n&gt; Dutch. WhereQuickScript provides us with Depending on who<br/>\n&gt; you ask, Dutch has anywhere between 16 and 28+ vowels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *   Most linguists seem to agree that Dutch has the<br/>\n&gt;     following monophthongs:<br/>\n&gt; *   /I/ &quot;kip&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *   /i/ &quot;biet&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *   /Y/ &quot;hut&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *   /y/ &quot;fuut&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *   /@/ &quot;de&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *   /A/ &quot;bad&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *   /a:/ &quot;zaad&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *   /O/ &quot;bot&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *   /u/ &quot;hoed&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *   Additionally, the following phonemes are considered<br/>\n&gt;     monophthongs or diphthongs, depending on who you ask<br/>\n&gt;     and/or where you live.<br/>\n&gt; *   /e:/ &quot;beet&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *   /\u00f8:/ &quot;neus&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *   /o:/ &quot;boot&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *   According to IPA, these are monophthongs. In Belgium,<br/>\n&gt;     these vowels indeed seem to have this monophthong<br/>\n&gt;     quality, but in the Netherlands, particularly in the<br/>\n&gt;     north, these vowels sound more like /eI/, /\u00f8y/ and /OU/<br/>\n&gt;     respectively.<br/>\n&gt; *   Then, according to IPA, there are the following<br/>\n&gt;     diphthongs:<br/>\n&gt; *   /Ei/ &quot;ei&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *   /\u0153y/ &quot;ui&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *   /Vu/ &quot;zout&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Apart from these 16 vowels, I hear a lot of other distinct<br/>\n&gt; vowel sounds in Dutch. Here my lack of linguistic schooling<br/>\n&gt; acts up, but I guess these are generally considered<br/>\n&gt; &quot;allophones&quot; of the primary 16 vowels, as follows:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *   /a/ or /6/ &quot;kameel&quot;. an allophone of /a:/, occuring in<br/>\n&gt;     unstressed syllables.<br/>\n&gt; *   /I:/ &quot;keren&quot;; an allophone of /e:/ &quot;beet&quot;. Both /I:/ and<br/>\n&gt;     /e:/ are considered expressions of the morpheme &quot;lange<br/>\n&gt;     e&quot; (&quot;long e&quot;). The consonant following the vowel<br/>\n&gt;     determine which allophone is to be pronounced. Note the<br/>\n&gt;     difference in meaning between &quot;kirren&quot; /kIr@n/ and<br/>\n&gt;     &quot;keren&quot; /kI:r@n/.<br/>\n&gt; *   /O:/ &quot;hoor&quot;; an allophone of /o:/ &quot;boot&quot;. Again, the<br/>\n&gt;     consonant(s) following the vowel determines which<br/>\n&gt;     allophone is used.<br/>\n&gt; *   /Y:/ &quot;keur&quot;; an allophone of /\u00f8:/ &quot;keus&quot;. Again, the<br/>\n&gt;     consonant(s) following the vowel determines which<br/>\n&gt;     allophone is used.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Finally, Dutch has a number of vowels that are used rarely,<br/>\n&gt; and (almost?) exclusively in French loanwords:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *   /\u0153:/ &quot;oeuvre&quot;; also commonly pronounced as /Y:/ &quot;keur&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; *   /O~/ &quot;caisson&quot;; almost identical to /O/ &quot;bot&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; *   /E~/ &quot;electricien&quot;; also commonly pronounced as /En/<br/>\n&gt;     &quot;en&quot;<br/>\n&gt; *   /A~/ &quot;restaurant&quot;; almost identical to /A/ &quot;bad&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; *   /\u0153~/ &quot;parfum&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After having stared at Read&#39;s solutions to the intricacies<br/>\n&gt; of English vowel pronunciation a bit, and after trying to<br/>\n&gt; meaningfully map Dutch vowels onto Read&#39;s vowels and<br/>\n&gt; corresponding letters, I cannot but decide that Dutch is so<br/>\n&gt; much different from English, that it requires a different<br/>\n&gt; approach altogether. AFAICS, Read&#39;s original approach, with<br/>\n&gt; a purely phonetic spelling and almost completely eliminating<br/>\n&gt; multigrams, is simply not feasible for the Dutch language.<br/>\n&gt; The number of graphemes required would be inconcievably<br/>\n&gt; large.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The solution I&#39;d like to propose is to map Dutch _phonemes_<br/>\n&gt; on QuickScript characters, instead of _phones_. From what<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve read over the last few days, &quot;phonetic vs. phonemic vs.<br/>\n&gt; morphemic&quot; is subject of a heated debate among spelling<br/>\n&gt; reformers to-be. Read clearly took the &quot;phonetic&quot; point of<br/>\n&gt; view, although some of the characters actually seem to<br/>\n&gt; represent phonemes rather than phones. I&#39;d like to suggest<br/>\n&gt; that we take this a few steps further in the Dutch version<br/>\n&gt; of QuickScript. First, I don&#39;t think we have a choice;<br/>\n&gt; second, there have been extensive spelling reforms in Dutch<br/>\n&gt; already, which already succesfully addressed many of the<br/>\n&gt; problems in current English. In these reforms, a morphemic<br/>\n&gt; approach seem to have been taken, and this is what Dutch<br/>\n&gt; writers are used to already. In fact, I think many Dutch<br/>\n&gt; speakers don&#39;t even realize that the &quot;long e&quot; morpheme is<br/>\n&gt; pronounced differently in &quot;peer&quot; /pI:r/ and &quot;peen&quot; /pe:n/.<br/>\n&gt; To most of us, it just sounds like a &quot;long e&quot;, and it<br/>\n&gt; requires careful listening to hear that it can in fact be<br/>\n&gt; vocalized in two different ways. I&#39;m convinced that it would<br/>\n&gt; be highly counter-intuitive for most Dutch writers if<br/>\n&gt; different graphemes be used for _ee_ in &quot;peer&quot; and &quot;peen&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Looking at vowel frequencies, there&#39;s another important<br/>\n&gt; difference between English and Dutch: in English, the most<br/>\n&gt; frequent phonemes are /I/ (9.9%), /i/ (5.0%), /@/ (3.4%) and<br/>\n&gt; /A/ (3.3%). In Dutch, the most frequent morphemes are /@/<br/>\n&gt; (11.7%), /A/ (4.8%), /E/ (3.7%) and /a:/ (3.6%). Percentages<br/>\n&gt; depend on what is counted, dialect, corpus etc., but for<br/>\n&gt; this discussion any generally accepted frequency<br/>\n&gt; distribution suffices, I think. In short, the most frequent<br/>\n&gt; Dutch phoneme (/@/) by far is only takes third place in the<br/>\n&gt; English frequency distribution. And vice versa, the most<br/>\n&gt; common phoneme in English by far (/I/) takes fifth place in<br/>\n&gt; the Dutch frequency distribution. This might be taken into<br/>\n&gt; consideration when designing a Dutch QuickScript.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m gonna leave it at this for now. I already have a first<br/>\n&gt; version of a new Dutch QuickScript mapping, but I&#39;d rather<br/>\n&gt; not release it yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best regards, Pieter<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *._,_.*_<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your email settings: Individual Email|Traditional Change<br/>\n&gt; settings via the Web (Yahoo!

I\nalso inserted &#39;bullets&#39; in your indented paragraphs so\nthat my email reformatter shouldn&#39;t mangle them. (I\nhave to reformat to narrow columns to accommodate a\nvision problem.)\n\nMy vowel letter assignments are as follows, taking into\nconsideration both the frequency of the vowel letters\nin Swedish text -- wanting to assign the simplest signs\nto the most frequent vowels -- *and* trying not to\nstray too far from the English values at least for the\nshort vowels:\n\n\nSpelling\tShort\tQS\t\tLong\tQS\n----------  ------  ------  ------  ---------\ni\t\t\t/I/\t\t#26\t\t/i:/\t#27\ne\t\t\t(/e/)\t#28\t\t/e:/\t#29\n\ufffd\t\t\t/E/\t\t#30\t\t/E:/\t#31\n\ufffd\t\t\t/\ufffd/\t\t#32\t\t/\ufffd:/\t#33\n\ufffd\t\t\t/O/\t\t#34\t\t/o:/\t#35\na\t\t\t/a/\t\t#36\t\t/A:/\t#37\no\t\t\t/U/\t\t#38\t\t/u:/\t#38*[^1]\nu\t\t\t/\ufffd/\t\t#39\t\t/Yw/\t#40\ny\t\t\t/Y/\t\t#18\t\t/yj/\t#20\n\n[^1]:\t#38* is a by me newly designed long counterpart\n         to #38, essentially a mirror-image of Read&#39;s\n         #29+#25 _ai/r_ ligature. Theoretically it could\n         be read as #36+#31, but such a combination\n         /aE:/ would not normally occur in Swedish.\n\nFor Dutch you obviously don&#39;t *need* to stray that far\nfrom the English values, but since the Dutch vowels\npretty much fall into lax ~ tense / diphthong ~\nmonophthong pairs (and considering their spellings with\npairs like _a/aa, e/ee, i/ie, o/oo, u/uu_ it might\nstill be a good idea to use the QS vowel sign pairs\ncorresponding to the orthographic single/double letter\npairs thusly:\n\n\nSpelling\tPhoneme\t\tQS\t\tSpelling\tPhoneme\t\tQS\n----------  ----------  ------  ----------  ----------  ---------\ni\t\t\t/I/\t\t\t#26\t\tie\t\t\t/i/\t\t\t#27\ne\t\t\t/E/@/\t\t#28\t\tee\t\t\t/e/eI/\t\t#29\na\t\t\t/A/\t\t\t#30\t\taa\t\t\t/a/\t\t\t#31\nei, ij\t\t/Ei/\t\t#32\t\tou\t\t\t/Vu/\t\t#33\no\t\t\t/O/\t\t\t#34\t\too\t\t\t/o/oU/\t\t#35\nu\t\t\t/Y/\t\t\t#36\t\tuu\t\t\t/y/\t\t\t#37\noe\t\t\t/u/\t\t\t#38\neu\t\t\t/\ufffd:/\ufffdY/\t\t#39\t\tui\t\t\t/\ufffdy/\t\t#40\n\nThe other vowels you list are, as you suspect\nallophones. A book I have lists the phoneme inventories\nof a lot of languages, and for Dutch it gives just the\n15 vowel phonemes of your primary list, which I have\ntentatively mapped to QS letters above. It also says\nthat funny things happen with vowels before /r/, and\nmost of your &#39;extra&#39; vowels/allophones fit into that\ndescription. (That&#39;s not unusual BTW: look at the havoc\n/r/ after vowels wrought on English for example -- just\ncompare the spelling and the modern pronunciation!\nIt also says that /E: \ufffd: O:/ and nasalized vowels\noccur marginally in French loan words, but since\nthey are marginal I see no reason not to write them with\nthe same letters as their short counterparts, and with\nthe letters for the corresponding non-nasalized vowels\n+ #21 or + #23.\n\nAlso it is probably a good idea when adapting QS to a\nlanguage which, like Dutch and Swedish, but unlike\nEnglish, still has a more or less &#39;sane&#39; Latin letter\northography, to go for a systematic and simple mapping\nbetween Latin letter spellings and QS letters. All those\nallophones, like similar delinquents in Swedish BTW,\ndon&#39;t have their own spellings, which probably means that\nspeakers/writers of an overall &#39;sanely&#39; written language,\nwhere in the overwhelming majority of cases the pronunciation can\nbe derived from the spelling by straightforward rules,\nwill have a hard time sorting out those allophones and\nmarginal phonemes which share a spelling with some similar\nsound. It&#39;s simply overkill to attempt to spell them\ndistinctively -- and it&#39;s probably mostly overkill to\ndistinguish /\ufffd/ and /A/ in English too, BTW.\n\nAs for the consonants the biggest issue is of course\nhow to write /x/ and /G/. I&#39;d suggest a radical\nsolution: reassign #7 to /x/ and #8 to /G/, using the\nsymbols for an English pair of phonemes which don&#39;t\noccur in Dutch for a Dutch pair of phonemes which\ndoesn&#39;t occur in English. This way you also get a very\nattractive ligature #11+#7 for /sx/. If you feel a need\nto write the English &#39;th&#39; sounds with a separate\nletter, rather than replacing them with /t/d/ or /s/z/\nor whatever they get replaced with when adapting\nEnglish words to Dutch phonology. you can use the loCH\nletter for them -- even turn it upside down if you want\nto distinguish [D] from [T], even though the functional\nload of the /T/~/D/ distinction in English is rather\nlow, and will be even lower in the range of loans into\nDutch. (We have the same problem in Swedish: /T/, but\n/D/ much less so, is on its way to become a\nloan-phoneme in Swedish for a few speakers, but most\nreplace English /T/ with /t/, and practically everyone\nreplaces /D/ with /d/.)\n\nRegards,\n\n/bpj\n\n&gt; Best regards, Pieter (pronounced /pit@r/)\n&gt;\n&gt; CONSONANTS FREQUENCIES There is a number of remarkable\n&gt; differences is consonant frequencies that I think should be\n&gt; taken into consideration.\n&gt;\n&gt; *   Dutch completely lacks the English /T/, /D/ and // w(#7\n&gt;     and #8).\n&gt; *   The phonemes /g/, /S/, /tS/, and /dZ/ (#6, #13, #15\n&gt;     and #16), while common in English, are rare in Dutch,\n&gt;     occuring almost exclusively in loanwords, as in &quot;goal&quot;,\n&gt;     &quot;shock&quot;, &quot;check&quot; and &quot;gel&quot;.\n&gt; *   The phoneme /Z/ (#14) seems to be rare in both\n&gt;     languages. In Dutch it only occurs in loanwords, like\n&gt;     &quot;journaal&quot;.\n&gt; *   English completely lacks phonemes /G/ and /x/ (which are\n&gt;     very common in Dutch and make us sound like Klingons.\n&gt;     Read invented the letter &quot;lo-CH&quot; to be able to write\n&gt;     Scottish names, but given the high frequency of /G/ and\n&gt;     /x/ in Dutch I suggest a more versatile character be\n&gt;     used.\n&gt; *   The &quot;lo-CH&quot; letter always starts &quot;tall&quot; and ends on the\n&gt;     lower parallel, which would cause frequent penlifts for\n&gt;     Dutch writers.\n&gt; *   /G/ is most frequently preceded by /@/ and /OU/, and\n&gt;     followed by /@/, /r/, /eI/ and /I/.\n&gt; *   /x/ is most frequently preceded by /A/, /E/ and /s/ (eg.\n&gt;     in the infamous word &quot;Scheveningen&quot;), and followed by a\n&gt;     /t/ or /r/. The combination /sxr/ (as in &quot;schrijven&quot;) is\n&gt;     particularly frequent.\n&gt;\n&gt; CONSONANT USE In Dutch, consonants at the end of a word are\n&gt; (almost) always voiceless, even if they stem from (and are\n&gt; written as) a voiced consonant. For example: &quot;bod&quot; /bOt/,\n&gt; &quot;eb&quot; /Ep/, &quot;maag&quot; /ma:x/. In English, voiced consonants at\n&gt; word endings are common, as in &quot;stub&quot;, &quot;naked&quot; (and many\n&gt; other words ending with &quot;-ed&quot;), &quot;dig&quot;, &quot;love&quot;, &quot;was&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;page&quot;. This remarkable difference could be taken into\n&gt; consideration. Eg. Read designed is alphabet such that\n&gt; voiced consonants /b/, /d/ and /z/ are particularly easy to\n&gt; write at word endings, using the alternative character for\n&gt; #2, #4 and #12 respectively. Note particularly the plural\n&gt; /z/ at the end of many English plurals, eg. &quot;berries&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; VOWELS In consonants, there&#39;s enough overlap between Dutch\n&gt; and English to make QuickScript suitable for Dutch without\n&gt; major changes. consonants, so Dutch has a lot more vowels\n&gt; than English. Many of the vowels in English do not occur in\n&gt; Dutch. WhereQuickScript provides us with Depending on who\n&gt; you ask, Dutch has anywhere between 16 and 28+ vowels.\n&gt;\n&gt; *   Most linguists seem to agree that Dutch has the\n&gt;     following monophthongs:\n&gt; *   /I/ &quot;kip&quot;\n&gt; *   /i/ &quot;biet&quot;\n&gt; *   /Y/ &quot;hut&quot;\n&gt; *   /y/ &quot;fuut&quot;\n&gt; *   /@/ &quot;de&quot;\n&gt; *   /A/ &quot;bad&quot;\n&gt; *   /a:/ &quot;zaad&quot;\n&gt; *   /O/ &quot;bot&quot;\n&gt; *   /u/ &quot;hoed&quot;\n&gt; *   Additionally, the following phonemes are considered\n&gt;     monophthongs or diphthongs, depending on who you ask\n&gt;     and/or where you live.\n&gt; *   /e:/ &quot;beet&quot;\n&gt; *   /\ufffd:/ &quot;neus&quot;\n&gt; *   /o:/ &quot;boot&quot;\n&gt; *   According to IPA, these are monophthongs. In Belgium,\n&gt;     these vowels indeed seem to have this monophthong\n&gt;     quality, but in the Netherlands, particularly in the\n&gt;     north, these vowels sound more like /eI/, /\ufffdy/ and /OU/\n&gt;     respectively.\n&gt; *   Then, according to IPA, there are the following\n&gt;     diphthongs:\n&gt; *   /Ei/ &quot;ei&quot;\n&gt; *   /\ufffdy/ &quot;ui&quot;\n&gt; *   /Vu/ &quot;zout&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Apart from these 16 vowels, I hear a lot of other distinct\n&gt; vowel sounds in Dutch. Here my lack of linguistic schooling\n&gt; acts up, but I guess these are generally considered\n&gt; &quot;allophones&quot; of the primary 16 vowels, as follows:\n&gt;\n&gt; *   /a/ or /6/ &quot;kameel&quot;. an allophone of /a:/, occuring in\n&gt;     unstressed syllables.\n&gt; *   /I:/ &quot;keren&quot;; an allophone of /e:/ &quot;beet&quot;. Both /I:/ and\n&gt;     /e:/ are considered expressions of the morpheme &quot;lange\n&gt;     e&quot; (&quot;long e&quot;). The consonant following the vowel\n&gt;     determine which allophone is to be pronounced. Note the\n&gt;     difference in meaning between &quot;kirren&quot; /kIr@n/ and\n&gt;     &quot;keren&quot; /kI:r@n/.\n&gt; *   /O:/ &quot;hoor&quot;; an allophone of /o:/ &quot;boot&quot;. Again, the\n&gt;     consonant(s) following the vowel determines which\n&gt;     allophone is used.\n&gt; *   /Y:/ &quot;keur&quot;; an allophone of /\ufffd:/ &quot;keus&quot;. Again, the\n&gt;     consonant(s) following the vowel determines which\n&gt;     allophone is used.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, Dutch has a number of vowels that are used rarely,\n&gt; and (almost?) exclusively in French loanwords:\n&gt;\n&gt; *   /\ufffd:/ &quot;oeuvre&quot;; also commonly pronounced as /Y:/ &quot;keur&quot;.\n&gt; *   /O~/ &quot;caisson&quot;; almost identical to /O/ &quot;bot&quot;.\n&gt; *   /E~/ &quot;electricien&quot;; also commonly pronounced as /En/\n&gt;     &quot;en&quot;\n&gt; *   /A~/ &quot;restaurant&quot;; almost identical to /A/ &quot;bad&quot;.\n&gt; *   /\ufffd~/ &quot;parfum&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; After having stared at Read&#39;s solutions to the intricacies\n&gt; of English vowel pronunciation a bit, and after trying to\n&gt; meaningfully map Dutch vowels onto Read&#39;s vowels and\n&gt; corresponding letters, I cannot but decide that Dutch is so\n&gt; much different from English, that it requires a different\n&gt; approach altogether. AFAICS, Read&#39;s original approach, with\n&gt; a purely phonetic spelling and almost completely eliminating\n&gt; multigrams, is simply not feasible for the Dutch language.\n&gt; The number of graphemes required would be inconcievably\n&gt; large.\n&gt;\n&gt; The solution I&#39;d like to propose is to map Dutch _phonemes_\n&gt; on QuickScript characters, instead of _phones_. From what\n&gt; I&#39;ve read over the last few days, &quot;phonetic vs. phonemic vs.\n&gt; morphemic&quot; is subject of a heated debate among spelling\n&gt; reformers to-be. Read clearly took the &quot;phonetic&quot; point of\n&gt; view, although some of the characters actually seem to\n&gt; represent phonemes rather than phones. I&#39;d like to suggest\n&gt; that we take this a few steps further in the Dutch version\n&gt; of QuickScript. First, I don&#39;t think we have a choice;\n&gt; second, there have been extensive spelling reforms in Dutch\n&gt; already, which already succesfully addressed many of the\n&gt; problems in current English. In these reforms, a morphemic\n&gt; approach seem to have been taken, and this is what Dutch\n&gt; writers are used to already. In fact, I think many Dutch\n&gt; speakers don&#39;t even realize that the &quot;long e&quot; morpheme is\n&gt; pronounced differently in &quot;peer&quot; /pI:r/ and &quot;peen&quot; /pe:n/.\n&gt; To most of us, it just sounds like a &quot;long e&quot;, and it\n&gt; requires careful listening to hear that it can in fact be\n&gt; vocalized in two different ways. I&#39;m convinced that it would\n&gt; be highly counter-intuitive for most Dutch writers if\n&gt; different graphemes be used for _ee_ in &quot;peer&quot; and &quot;peen&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Looking at vowel frequencies, there&#39;s another important\n&gt; difference between English and Dutch: in English, the most\n&gt; frequent phonemes are /I/ (9.9%), /i/ (5.0%), /@/ (3.4%) and\n&gt; /A/ (3.3%). In Dutch, the most frequent morphemes are /@/\n&gt; (11.7%), /A/ (4.8%), /E/ (3.7%) and /a:/ (3.6%). Percentages\n&gt; depend on what is counted, dialect, corpus etc., but for\n&gt; this discussion any generally accepted frequency\n&gt; distribution suffices, I think. In short, the most frequent\n&gt; Dutch phoneme (/@/) by far is only takes third place in the\n&gt; English frequency distribution. And vice versa, the most\n&gt; common phoneme in English by far (/I/) takes fifth place in\n&gt; the Dutch frequency distribution. This might be taken into\n&gt; consideration when designing a Dutch QuickScript.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m gonna leave it at this for now. I already have a first\n&gt; version of a new Dutch QuickScript mapping, but I&#39;d rather\n&gt; not release it yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards, Pieter\n&gt;\n&gt; *._,_.*_\n&gt;\n&gt; Your email settings: Individual Email|Traditional Change\n&gt; settings via the Web (Yahoo!
