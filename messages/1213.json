(It&#39;s not clear<br/>\nwhether &quot;me&quot; for &quot;my&quot; is a special pronunciation of the word &quot;my&quot;,<br/>\nor a special use of the word &quot;me&quot;, BTW.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In the same vein, I think dialects such as <br/>\n&gt; the one you describe would naturally write in a standard dialect. I <br/>\n&gt; think you are bringing up a rare case, one in which some speakers <br/>\n&gt; distinguish between two words with sounds that others would not be able <br/>\n&gt; to hear.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, let&#39;s take an example I *can* document:  in Australian English,<br/>\n&quot;come&quot; and &quot;calm&quot; are a minimal pair differing only in vowel length.<br/>\nNor is the distinction confined to this one word: *all* the words that<br/>\nuse IPA [V] in N.A. and the U.K. use [a] in Australia, and all the ones<br/>\nwith IPA [A] are pronounced using [a:].  QS, alas, has no letter for IPA<br/>\n[a] at all, much less [a:], only for IPA [A] and IPA [V] (#32 Ah and<br/>\n#36 Utter, respectively).<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you going to argue that twenty million people should write in some<br/>\ndialect they only hear on TV?  Or does QS need another letter?  Or do<br/>\nwe allow people to use the QS letters to represent the oppositions that<br/>\nare in fact natural for their way of speaking English?<br/>\n<br/>\n(Note that English doesn&#39;t really have any standard dialects: cultivated<br/>\npeople in Boston, Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco, London, Sydney,<br/>\nPretoria, and New Delhi don&#39;t even aspire to speak the same way, never<br/>\nmind actually doing so.  Indeed, in the U.S. the differences between<br/>\nvarieties are growing wider, not narrower, and two new widely spoken<br/>\ndialects have appeared that did not exist sixty years ago.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My understanding is that QS does have enough phonemes to describe <br/>\n&gt; everyone&#39;s dialect. If there are lots of cases in which speakers use the <br/>\n&gt; same sound, but in different ways to mean a different word, that means <br/>\n&gt; that there are more than 40 phonemes, and that QS is inadequate in how <br/>\n&gt; it was devised and how we think of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Only if you hold on to the assumption that phonemes = sounds, which they<br/>\naren&#39;t.  I don&#39;t blame you for being confused on this point; Read plainly<br/>\nwas also.  It&#39;s also true that 40 phonemes is too few for some dialects<br/>\nand too many for others, but as Michael Everson says, it&#39;s good enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyway, you are saying that the sit-seat people should use different QS <br/>\n&gt; letters to distinguish between their words, but aren&#39;t you just <br/>\n&gt; describing a variation of TO? If you say that the words are different <br/>\n&gt; and that we are going to assign them letters not necessarily on how they <br/>\n&gt; sound, but just to distinguish them, then we are moving away from the <br/>\n&gt; phonomical basis for QS and towards the rigid spelling of TO.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, yes -- in the sense that TO was a phonemic (not phonetic)<br/>\northography for the variety of English spoken in Southern England<br/>\nabout 500 years ago.  It continues to make distinctions that only a<br/>\ntiny minority of anglophones still make, and it utterly fails to make<br/>\ndistinctions that are necessary for the Englishes of today, either<br/>\nbecause of the inadequacy of the un-extended Latin alphabet, or because<br/>\nthey were not yet made in that time, or simply because nobody noticed<br/>\nthem at the time when English spelling was first being standardized.<br/>\nIt&#39;s also full of absolutely pointless irregularities like the &quot;h&quot; in<br/>\n&quot;ghost&quot;, which serve no purpose whatsoever.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But I don&#39;t think you can really base QS on phonemic opposition. It is <br/>\n&gt; more complicated than what I am suggesting. Of course, I understand that <br/>\n&gt; one can use phonemical opposition without understanding the principal <br/>\n&gt; behind it, but I don&#39;t see it as really a good way to describe how QS <br/>\n&gt; works. Aren&#39;t you just talking about the difference between phonemes and <br/>\n&gt; allophones?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not entirely.  In a single dialect, there may be multiple allophones<br/>\nof a phoneme; but across dialects, *entirely different* sounds may be<br/>\nused to represent common phonemes.  Let&#39;s look at an example from the<br/>\nconsonants this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the speech of many (not all) speakers of Irish English, the unvoiced<br/>\nsound of &quot;th&quot; is represented not by a fricative, as elsewhere in the<br/>\nworld, but but by a stop.  However, that does not mean that the t/th<br/>\nopposition is lost and &quot;tin&quot; sounds exactly like &quot;thin&quot;; it does not.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather, &quot;th&quot; is pronounced using a dental stop, in which the tip of<br/>\nthe tongue touches the back of the teeth (the same sound as in French,<br/>\nSpanish, or Italian &quot;t&quot;), whereas &quot;t&quot; is pronounced as the rest of us do,<br/>\nas an alveolar stop, where the tip of the tongue touches the ridges just<br/>\nabove the teeth.  The two sounds are similar or indistinguishable to<br/>\nmost anglophones, but in Ireland they constitute a phonemic opposition --<br/>\nthey matter, they make a difference to understanding which word is<br/>\nbeing spoken.  (The same is true for the voiced sound of &quot;th&quot; vs. &quot;d&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are the four million Irish to do?  They seem to have the same<br/>\nchoices as the Australians with their low vowels:<br/>\n<br/>\n(a) introduce two new QS letters for sounds unique to their dialect,<br/>\n    which nobody else will be able to read at all;<br/>\n<br/>\n(b) learn a foreign dialect in order to become literate;<br/>\n<br/>\n(c) write thin and tin, thy and die, thick and tick, breathe and breed,<br/>\n    and hundreds of other pairs of words exactly the same way while<br/>\n    continuing to distinguish them in speech (so much for the phonetic<br/>\n    principle!);<br/>\n<br/>\n(d) go ahead and use #7 Thaw for their unvoiced dental stop and<br/>\n    #8 They for their voiced one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI argue that (d) is the only sane choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think Read did more or less envision that QS covered all the <br/>\n&gt; phonemes in the English speaking world. He was wrong in thinking that <br/>\n&gt; the upper class British English would serve as a model for other <br/>\n&gt; dialects, and I think his limitation is causing confusion now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just so.  QS does cover all the *phonemes* in most of the English-speaking<br/>\nworld, but it doesn&#39;t come close to covering all the *sounds*, as in the<br/>\nexamples I have given above and many more.  What&#39;s more, representing<br/>\nsounds rather than phonemes may frequently cause severe misreadings.<br/>\nIf you read Et-Key-See-It-No-Tea, do you quickly and automatically realize<br/>\nthat you are &quot;hearing&quot; someone from New Zealand, and read the spoken word<br/>\n&quot;accent&quot; that you probably spell At-Key-See-Et-No-Tea?<br/>\n<br/>\nWorse yet, if you see Namedot-Eat-Utter-No, do you perceive this as<br/>\n&quot;Ian&quot;, or do you correctly realize that someone from the general area of<br/>\nBuffalo-Chicago-Indianapolis wrote this text, and the TO for that name<br/>\nis &quot;Ann&quot;?
