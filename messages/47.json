The concept that there \nis a &quot;correct&quot; way to spell a word and that any alternative spelling is \neither a mistake or the sign of a poor education became common relatively \nrecently in the history of the English language.  In Elizabethan times, \npeople spelt words the way they pronounced them, and no one thought that \npeculiar.\n\nWe recently saw videos in the United States of this year&#39;s National \nSpelling competition in which young people compete in spelling increasingly \nobscure words that no one uses.  A more mindless waste of students&#39; time \nand brainpower can hardly be imagined.  What should be a simple matter -- \nthe relationship of each letter of the alphabet to the phonemes of the \nlanguage has been almost hopelessly screwed up by the concept of a fixed \nspelling.  Once spelling was fixed and not allowed to change, the evolution \nof the language&#39;s pronunciation made the current desperate situation of \nEnglish orthography inevitable.  English now has hundreds of ways to spell \nits 44 or so phonemes, and a significant percentage of the population \ncannot master its intricacies, not to mention immigrants and others \nlearning English as a second language.\n\nRecently, a study showed that the same percentage of Italian readers suffer \nfrom dyslexia as do English readers, which makes sense -- there is no \nreason to expect dyslexia to be clustered in English speakers.   But \nItalian only has 37 or 38 ways to spell its 33 sounds, not hundreds of ways \nas English does.  Consequently, Italians who have dyslexia have generally \nremained unaware of their &quot;disability&quot; because it does not impede their \nability to read.  English dyslexics, on the other hand, suffer extreme \nproblems, as everyone now knows.  Educators, however, continue to insist \nthat the solution is simply more money, time and teachers, never realizing \nthe problem is in the alphabet, not the method of teaching.\n\nYou suggest the idea of compiling a dictionary for the Read alphabet.  When \nI look up the word &quot;dictionary&quot; in my Webster&#39;s Ninth Collegiate \nDictionary, I find: &quot;a reference book containing words usu. alphabetically \narranged along with information about their forms, pronunciations, \nfunctions, etymologies, meanings, and syntactical and idiomatic uses.&quot;  You \nwill notice it does not specifically mention spelling.  Although, it has \nbecome common to use a dictionary as an arbiter of &quot;correct&quot; spelling, it \nremains true that a dictionary&#39;s primary purpose is to define words.\n\nSo when you talk about a dictionary for the Read alphabet, I believe you \nare really suggesting we should produce a document that attempts to provide \n&quot;correct spellings,&quot; rather than letting people spell as they speak.  This \nresult of this, in my opinion, would be to fall back into the same trap the \nprinters led us into three centuries ago, and from which we are now trying \nto escape.\n\nPaige\n\n\nAt 07:01 PM 7/10/01 +0000, you wrote:\n&gt;Greetings,\n&gt;\n&gt;I was messing around with Rosetta lately (the program can be\n&gt;downloaded from the Shavian Yahoo-group at\n&gt;&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shavian&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shavian \n&gt;) and I was wondering if there\n&gt;would be a dictionary for Quikscript (Senior Quikscript).
