I thought that pdf <br/>\n&gt;&gt;     would be an effective way to upload these scanned handwritten letters so <br/>\n&gt;&gt;     I checked the googel docs site, and it stated that pdf was one of the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     formats they use.  So I then handwrote a letter, which was two pages <br/>\n&gt;&gt;     long, scanned it, saved it in pdf form, put it through PDF.995, which is <br/>\n&gt;&gt;     a free program which combined the two pages into a single document, and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     then went to google docs, registered and attempted to upload the pdf <br/>\n&gt;&gt;     file.  It was at this point after going to their user forums that I <br/>\n&gt;&gt;     discovered that you can only _download_ pdf files, not _upload_ them.  I <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     love sites that don&#39;t make it clear what their restrictions are!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     We could upload these letters to the group site, but how do we control <br/>\n&gt;&gt;     who adds to them and when or does it make a difference.  Also, <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     Yahoogroups limits our files saved on their server to 100mb.  We could <br/>\n&gt;&gt;     just send the pdf file as an attachment in an e-mail to the people <br/>\n&gt;&gt;     interested in the reading practice.  If we had a list of the people <br/>\n&gt;&gt;     interested, I could send my letter to the first person on the list, who <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     then adds their letter to it (again, using PDF.995 to combine the pdf <br/>\n&gt;&gt;     files), and forwards it to the next person on the list.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     Is there another format that would be more compact than pdf and/or work <br/>\n&gt;&gt;     better for what we are trying to accomplish?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     Any comments, ideas, suggestions?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     Paige<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;         <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Check out Ziphen Central!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Weekly posts on interesting and unique topics.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ziphen.benjaminbruce.com\">http://ziphen.benjaminbruce.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ziphen.benjaminbruce.com\">http://ziphen.benjaminbruce.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
