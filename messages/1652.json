I use all three sounds:  Awl, Ah and On.  In fact, \nI really don&#39;t understand what some people mean when they say they can&#39;t \nhear the difference between Awl and On.  It strikes me in a similar way \nas if they said they can&#39;t distinguish between blue and green.  \nObviously,  the boundary between the two colors is somewhat ambiguous, \nbut most of us have a clear enough idea of what blue is versus what \ngreen is.\n\nI have thought that those who say they can&#39;t hear the difference \nactually just means they don&#39;t use the Awl sound, i.e. they pronounce \nwords such as &quot;all&quot; with the On sound.  I expect that they can hear the \ndifference if they listen closely to someone pronouncing Awl versus On \neven if it is not a distinction they make in their own speech. \n\nThis whole thread seems to have started as a method to enable a \ndictionary to have all spelling variants placed together \nalphabetically.  Rather than throwing out a phoneme that many of us feel \nquite strongly about, it makes more sense to me that if there is a \nvariant spelling that will not be next to the others simply put in a \nnote directing the reader to the other spelling as in:  &quot;see also: _______.&quot;\n\nI also feel strongly about the continued availability of &quot;Wh&quot;.  I am \nsure that those who don&#39;t use it don&#39;t miss it, but I can assure you \nreading the QS news with nary a &quot;wh&quot; to be seen is noticed by me every \ntime I come across a word where I would use it.  I actually seem more \naware of its absence in writing than I am in hearing others who don&#39;t \nuse &quot;wh&quot; in their speech.\n\nPaige\n\nMoira O&#39;Brien wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As a speaker of RP, I can&#39;t agree to the merger \n&gt; of Awl Ah and On.
