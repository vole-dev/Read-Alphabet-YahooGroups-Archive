I would appreciate you letting me know if there is.  Like you I have not had much opportunity to read it and that is as important as writing it.  One way is by letter and I tried somewhat to promote that but no one was interested.  Like you I am not software savvy and have no idea how to make up a page for Kwikskript.

If you or anyone you <br/>\n&gt; know of has been using it for an extended period of time, let us hear <br/>\n&gt; from you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am a firm believer in the utility of Read&#39;s Alphabet as well as its <br/>\n&gt; viability as an alternative alphabet that could help people in their <br/>\n&gt; daily lives just as Kingsley Read suggested in the Quikscript Manual.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A little background on myself:  I am an attorney in private practice, <br/>\n&gt; who considers himself semi-computer literate.  By this I mean I am <br/>\n&gt; not knowledgable about specialized areas of computer science, such as <br/>\n&gt; designing fonts from scratch.  On the other hand, I am not afraid to <br/>\n&gt; open up my CPU to add hardware, and I remember what a DOS command <br/>\n&gt; is.  Hence, the semi-literate designation.  I bring this up because <br/>\n&gt; there are computer skills that I do not have, nor do I have the time <br/>\n&gt; to learn them in the near future, that would greatly enhance this <br/>\n&gt; site.  I do not doubt there are people in this group who already <br/>\n&gt; possess some of these skills and who, with a modest investment of <br/>\n&gt; time, could help us to turn this site into an attractive spot to <br/>\n&gt; attract more Read&#39;s Alphabet users.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To give you some idea of what I am talking about:  Here are several <br/>\n&gt; things I would like to see appear on this site.<br/>\n&gt; 1.  A copy of the Quikscript manual.  It is not copyrighted so there <br/>\n&gt; is no legal prohibition I am aware of that would prevent us from <br/>\n&gt; posting it.<br/>\n&gt; 2.  Texts written in Read&#39;s Alphabet.  These should be varying <br/>\n&gt; lengths and levels of complexity.  They could be original or copies <br/>\n&gt; of literary works in the public domain.<br/>\n&gt; 3.  A practice area for people to write back and forth to each other <br/>\n&gt; in Read&#39;s Alphabet to gain experience in reading other people&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; script.  I must admit that even after years of occasional use, I am <br/>\n&gt; not as fluent at reading Read&#39;s Alphabet as I am at reading roman.  <br/>\n&gt; Practice makes perfect, after all.  I read roman everyday.  I cannot <br/>\n&gt; say that about Read&#39;s Alphabet.  It is hard to get practice when the <br/>\n&gt; only person that knows the script is yourself.  I know by experience, <br/>\n&gt; it is not easy to get casual acquaintances to learn Read&#39;s Alphabet, <br/>\n&gt; but the internet gives us the chance to reach people from around the <br/>\n&gt; globe who are intellectually curious.  The internet gives us an <br/>\n&gt; inexpensive platform that could spread the word to others.<br/>\n&gt; 4.  Have all explanatory notes written in both roman and Read&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; Alphabet just as Androcles was printed in roman and Shavian.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For computer use we have the &quot;Jerome&quot; font, which was created about <br/>\n&gt; fifteen months ago.  I am excited about this as it gives us the <br/>\n&gt; opportunity to use the half-letters, which I found such an <br/>\n&gt; interesting facet of Read&#39;s Alphabet in handwriting as they provide <br/>\n&gt; word shapes that are more distinctive than those written with the <br/>\n&gt; full letters as in Junior Quikscript.  Jerome lets us use this <br/>\n&gt; feature in internet correspondence and teaching.  Jerome also shows <br/>\n&gt; that the letters can be joined in a &quot;cursive&quot; manner even <br/>\n&gt; in &quot;printing&quot; and remain graceful and attractive as opposed to the  <br/>\n&gt; detached and stilted Shavian.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On the other hand, Jerome was the work of a person new to computer <br/>\n&gt; fonts, and it is not perfect.  I am confident that someone familiar <br/>\n&gt; with computer fonts could redesign Jerome to improve it and make it <br/>\n&gt; even easier to use while maintaining its basic style.  I believe some <br/>\n&gt; of the letters need additional work to bring them closer to their <br/>\n&gt; appearance in the Quikscript manual.  Another problem is that <br/>\n&gt; sometimes the cursor position does not appear where the next letter <br/>\n&gt; will be inserted.  This can be confusing.  And why does it only <br/>\n&gt; happen sometimes?  I think this problem is related to the use of half-<br/>\n&gt; letters, but I am not sure of this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am interested in hearing your thoughts on this and any other <br/>\n&gt; matters connected to the use and spread of Read&#39;s Alphabet.
