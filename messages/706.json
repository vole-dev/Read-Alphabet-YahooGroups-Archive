Given that Shavian already has a Unicode mapping,<br/>\nit would probably be possible to re-use those encodings for glyphs<br/>\nwhich exist in both scripts.  We would only need to add glyphs for<br/>\n&quot;why&quot; &quot;loch&quot; &quot;llan&quot; &quot;excite&quot; and &quot;examine&quot;.  However, I have two<br/>\nreservations about this.  Firstly, there is the overloaded &quot;ado/up&quot;<br/>\nvowel, for which there are two characters in shavian but only one in<br/>\nquickscript.  Secondly, the shavian proposal included several<br/>\ndiphthongs as separate glyph encodings, &quot;ian&quot; &quot;ear&quot; &quot;air&quot; etc.  These<br/>\nreally should NOT be separate glyphs: they should be entered and<br/>\nstored as two separate glyphs, and only presented as ligatures when<br/>\nthey are displayed.  Giving ligatures a separate encoding will play<br/>\nhell with sorting/searching, etc.  In the same way, characters for<br/>\nwhich there are multiple glyphs, such as the multiple ways of writing<br/>\n&quot;may&quot; and &quot;no&quot;, should have only a single encoding but multiple<br/>\nassociated glyphs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat certainly has not gotten off the ground is a formal Unicode<br/>\nproposal.  According to:<br/>\n\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unicode.org/pending/proposals.html\">http://www.unicode.org/pending/proposals.html</a> *<br/>\nthe proposal process can take quite a long time--years--especially for<br/>\nentire scripts.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good first step is to gather comments from interested partied (that<br/>\nwould be all you people on this list), so that the proposed mapping<br/>\ncan be modified if necessary.
