Very few people are strict about writing the brief letters of \n&gt; Shaw&#39;s or Read&#39;s alphabet.  Letters may be ill-formed due to haste, etc.\n&gt; 5.  Finally, have you noticed that many dictionaries give two or more \n&gt; pronunciations to so many English words?

Tolkien/Elvish system of writing and\n    introduced to my eighth-grade self the idea of phonetic writing. I\n    spent a lot of time learning how to write American English in Elvish\n    &lt;i&gt;tengwar&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    Eventually, from prowling around on websites such as &quot;The Simplified\n    Spelling Society&quot; I found quickscript. I see this as the best\n    attempt to make a useful, usable phonetic alphabet &#8211; I could imagine\n    writing a journal in it.&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;moz-cite-prefix&quot;&gt;On 9/8/2012 8:58 PM, Sid Tanaban wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote\n      cite=&quot;mid:1347152331.65316.YahooMailNeo@...&quot;\n      type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n      \n          &lt;div id=&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div\n              style=&quot;color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:tahoma,\n              new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. &nbsp;Find an international dictionary and look\n                  it up!
