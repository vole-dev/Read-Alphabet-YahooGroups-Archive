But worse is that<br/>\nmost Americans could never use QS correctly as they would never know<br/>\nwhere to put other words with the &quot;apple&quot; sound ( sampa /{/   ). One<br/>\ncould try to write a Byzantine rule to help but it would never work<br/>\nbecause as John Cowan wrote earlier &quot;...If you can&#39;t hear the<br/>\ndifference, you&#39;re going to make mistakes...&quot;. And the result of these<br/>\ninevitable errors will be more illegible than QS written in dialect<br/>\never would.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Now if we let Americans use #30 for the word &quot;path&quot; then we must<br/>\nlet Tasmanians use #28 if they want.
