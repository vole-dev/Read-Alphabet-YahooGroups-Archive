  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-247663082\">First, I disagree with the statement &quot;QS is meant to be heard.&quot;  Not <br/>\nmeaning to be categorical, but QS is an attempt to realign English with <br/>\nan alphabet that works the way an alphabet is supposed to:  one sound = <br/>\none phoneme.  The QS manual starts off with the reasons why trying to <br/>\nredesign the Roman alphabet just doesn&#39;t cut it.  A new alphabet was needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I see with standardized spelling is that the <br/>\n&quot;English-speaking Peoples&quot; have no language academy to even attempt to <br/>\nenforce spelling changes as the language continues to evolve.  That is <br/>\nsort of how we got in this mess (TO) to begin with. <br/>\n<br/>\nI may be abysmally ignorant of the extent of English dialects, but I <br/>\nsuspect that for a very large majority of English speakers, i.e. the <br/>\nones clustered in the middle of the bell curve of English pronunciation, <br/>\nwe could get along just fine without a standardized spelling because the <br/>\nmajority of the words we use on a daily basis are not going to be spelt <br/>\nso peculiarly by someone from a different, but still one of the major <br/>\nspeech communities that it would not be recognizable.  To be sure, there <br/>\nare the outliers on that bell curve who would need to conform their <br/>\nspeech to a dialect in broader use than their own such as they would <br/>\nhear on the BBC or from American news outlets.  But for most of us, I <br/>\ndoubt we would need spelling police.  For example, if I write &quot;schedule&quot; <br/>\nwith a &quot;k&quot; sound, and a Londoner reads it, I seriously doubt, he would <br/>\nhave more than a moment&#39;s hesitation in deciphering the word even though <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t pronounce it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we start insisting that every word must be spelt in accordance with <br/>\nan arbitrary standard that does not match anyone&#39;s speech completely, <br/>\nthen we will be back to looking up many words and memorizing their <br/>\nspelling.  It is my understanding that in Shakespeare&#39;s time, the idea <br/>\nof proper spelling did not exist, and the Bard was quite content to <br/>\nspell a word one way today and differently tomorrow.

If we go too far <br/>\nastray, our readers won&#39;t understand, and we pay the price of not being <br/>\nread.  That by itself, forces a high level of conformism onto the <br/>\nsituation, but to insist that we all have to spell in lockstep or be <br/>\nconsidered morons is quite a different matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen a number of people insist that we have to have standardized <br/>\nspelling or we are doomed, but I doubt anyone has actually studied this <br/>\nso we have no real data as to how an alternative English alphabet would <br/>\nwork if it did or did not use standardized spelling.  For example, let <br/>\nus assume that we don&#39;t insist on standardized spelling and that it was <br/>\nlater found that that decision slowed the average reading speed by 5 or <br/>\n10 % (I doubt it would be any greater than that).  Would that not be a <br/>\nreasonable price to pay to avoid putting ourselves back in the position <br/>\nof attempting to memorize how words should be spelt rather than spelling <br/>\nthem the way they sound in speech?  I believe it would, especially for <br/>\nthe dyslexics among us, who cannot deal with arbitrary spellings.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a person occasionally is unsure how to spell a word because he <br/>\nsuspects he may pronounce it differently than others, he could always <br/>\nlook it up in a dictionary.
