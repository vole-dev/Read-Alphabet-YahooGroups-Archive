It has 15 letter keys, which are shifted by modifier keys, providing <br/>\nthe whole range of a regular keyboard. It&#39;s the size of an index card and works <br/>\nwith any computer or PDA.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantages:<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike QUERTY, the keyboard layout is based on letter frequency (as is the <br/>\nDvorak).  After a lot of research, I found that letter frequency in TO and sound <br/>\nfrequency in QS are close enough that this can be a real advantage to speedy <br/>\ntyping, even using the existing font mapping.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince no current keyboard will hold all the QS letters and half-letters without <br/>\nsome shifting anyway, you might as well have a keyboard where shifting has <br/>\nbeen optimized ergonomically. For example, to hit the second-level 15 letters, <br/>\nyou simultaneously hit a modifier key  with your thumb and a letter key. <br/>\nSounds weird, but works great. To hit the caps, you hit the cap shift followed <br/>\nby the letter key.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are going to learn a keyboard mapping for QS, you are probably better <br/>\noff learning it on a unique keyboard, so that you don&#39;t have the mental <br/>\ngymnastics of shifting back and forth.
