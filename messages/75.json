  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1048294223\">Two thoughts on Jerome and computer typing in quickscript:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have only recently begun to read Shavian and Quickscript.  I enjoy <br/>\nsome of the advantages of both.  Read&#39;s extension of abreviations and <br/>\nabreviated words in Quickscript seem wonderful.  However, I find the <br/>\nsmall &quot;curleys&quot; in the type version of Jerome hard on my eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really appreciate the hard work done on Jerome, but believe <br/>\nQuickscript readers could also do with a font that does not look like <br/>\npenmanship.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom reading Read&#39;s booklet on Quickscript, it appears that most of <br/>\nthe half letter and joinings were instituted to make writing with a <br/>\npen easier, not reading easier.  Much like script penmanship, I <br/>\nbelieve that most of them detract from the readability of the text <br/>\nwhen the text is in an electronic version.  (BTW, I gave up on script <br/>\nwriting in the seventh grade about 36 years ago and have been <br/>\nprinting ever since so that my handwriting can be easily read.  I use <br/>\nthe computer to write letters for the same reason.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can not imagine wanting to read a font on the computer which <br/>\nattempts to mimic script...  I know they exist, but to prefer this <br/>\nfor everyday reading!  No thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been thinking along two lines.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, is there already a version of Quickscript True Type font which <br/>\nlooks more like the Junior Quickscript of Read&#39;s manual?  If not, I <br/>\nmay invest a little time and come up with one.  I think it could <br/>\nimprove readability in the way that ghoti and lionspaw are very <br/>\nreadable Shavian scripts.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, is there a way to program the keyboard interface to scan for <br/>\ncombination letters other than shift, ctl and alt?  I recently worked <br/>\non a 7 key keyboard that used &quot;chord fingerings&quot;  for letters.  Chord <br/>\nfingerings seem like a natural for phonetic languages like <br/>\nQuickscript.  It is easy enough to remember cap T for &quot;theater&quot; but <br/>\ncap Y for &quot;oil&quot;??  Would it not be nice to just press the o and i <br/>\nkeys?  The computer would run the following algorhythm when you <br/>\npressed the o key... hmmm... o key, must be an o, ... no the i key is <br/>\nalso pressed must be an &quot;oil&quot;  now wait for the next letter press.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not worked the keyboard interface to see if this kind of chord <br/>\nkeying could be instituted within the present operating systems or <br/>\nnot.
