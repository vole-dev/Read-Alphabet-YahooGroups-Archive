  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1736551670\">Dear All,<br/>\n<br/>\nLately I&#39;ve been tinkering away on the King Plus font, and in doing so I&#39;m teaching myself how to edit a font. When saving the font, I get messages warning that the font contains errors, mainly some self-intersecting glyphs and some &quot;paths&quot; not being created in the correct direction. These errors might account for some strange formatting glitches I&#39;m having in some LibreOffice documents in which I&#39;ve used the font. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m basically learning what I need to in order to fix these problems, before I move along and try my hand at designing new fonts. But I&#39;d like to make sure I&#39;m not reinventing the wheel. Does anyone have any other fonts available for us to use? I see that in addition to the King Plus font, we do also have a nicely-done Thoth font in the files section (without all those font errors). But for now I&#39;d like to stick to King Plus, since I especially like the shapes of the letters. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis question came to mind recently when someone named Tim uploaded a nice PDF of The Call of Cthulhu: I noticed that it used another version of the King Plus font, with excellent kerning (character spacing). I wondered whether that font also had its errors resolved already. I tried contacting Tim directly. (Are you out there, Tim?) <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve started work on retracing existing characters without self-intersecting them. I&#39;m using Fontforge, an open-source program with a couple of shortcomings: It likes to crash when you do certain things, such as moving a glyph. And it often makes curves into straight line segments when you don&#39;t want that, and it won&#39;t allow them to be changed back. It seems I have to add some extra points in order to approximate curves in some places. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll appreciate whatever information, leads, or tips you all can offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe Well,<br/>\n<br/>\nScott</div>",
