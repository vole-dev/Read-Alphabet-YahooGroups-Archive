It is simply the &quot;w&quot; symbol<br/>\n&gt;       with a hook at the bottom so it should be easy to add to the<br/>\n&gt;       font.

When I opened the font, in several places there were rectangular<br/>\n&gt;       boxes.  I wasn&#39;t sure if some of these may have been glyphs not<br/>\n&gt;       displaying correctly.
