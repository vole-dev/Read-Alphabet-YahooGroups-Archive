I&#39;m sure there&#39;s countless others out there, too. Although I haven&#39;t really researched Quikscript enough to become a fan of it (someone sent me the manual for it years ago, but I found it too confusing compared at the time to the simplicity of Shavian), I&#39;d probably buy a book or two written in Quikscript, especially if it was on a subject of interest to me, but the only info I found on publication in this group was a message by tim_rice09 back on July 4th, 2006. Since I found the other groups, I was pretty impressed with the transliterated works\n that people posted to the files section, but so long as that&#39;s ALL that&#39;s done, phonetic spelling over all will only be seen by the general public as a pipe dream. It&#39;ll take publication for people to REALLY sit up and take notice and to build overall awareness. It doesn&#39;t really matter to me which system &quot;wins&quot;, so long as traditional orthography ends up being the loser.<br>\n<br>\n</div>\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div><br><br> </div> </div> </blockquote></span></blockquote></div>   </div></html></div>",

I was wondering, has anyone ever tried to get =\r\nanything published in Quikscript? I first decided to publish my book becaus=\r\ne I felt that the world as a whole NEEDS to learn about how to make English=\r\n spelling phonetic. I learned about Quikscript later, and later still about=\r\n Unifon. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s countless others out there, too. Although I haven=\r\n&#39;t really researched Quikscript enough to become a fan of it (someone sent =\r\nme the manual for it years ago, but I found it too confusing compared at th=\r\ne time to the simplicity of Shavian), I&#39;d probably buy a book or two writte=\r\nn in Quikscript, especially if it was on a subject of interest to me, but t=\r\nhe only info I found on publication in this group was a message by tim_rice=\r\n09 back on July 4th, 2006. Since I found the other groups, I was pretty imp=\r\nressed with the transliterated works\n that people posted to the files secti=\r\non, but so long as that&#39;s ALL that&#39;s done, phonetic spelling over all will =\r\nonly be seen by the general public as a pipe dream. It&#39;ll take publication =\r\nfor people to REALLY sit up and take notice and to build overall awareness.=\r\n It doesn&#39;t really matter to me which system &quot;wins&quot;, so long as traditional=\r\n orthography ends up being the loser.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body=\r\n&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1108643031-1685490220-1357383226=:64539--\r\n\n"
