  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-624408721\">\n<html>\n<head>\n  \n</head>\n \nThe apostrophe is generally not used to mark plurals in Quikscript or\nShavian because they&#39;re phonetically and phonemically identical to\npossessives. But for contractions, where words are shortened and\nconnected, they&#39;re usually retained.<br>\nAs for that accent, I don&#39;t have a copy of the Quikscript manual on\nhand--I know I saved it somewhere--but isn&#39;t it just a short vertical\nline or dot? If so, then there is a combining character for it in\nUnicode. The character &quot;COMBINING VERTICAL LINE ABOVE&quot; at the codepoint\n030D, and the &quot;COMBINING DOT ABOVE&quot; is 0307. Neither is specific to any\nscript, so it should be fine to use them with Quikscript. Here are both\nof them on the letter <i>o</i> for reference: o&#781; o&#775;<br>\n<br>\nThose may not display correctly. Using Thunderbird on my Mac, only the\nfirst one does. Assuming you&#39;ve got decent Unicode support, it&#39;s\nfunctionality will depend mostly on the font you&#39;re using. So as long\nas your Quikscript font has the character in a working state, it should\ndisplay correctly.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, I don&#39;t think setting Senior Quikscript on a computer will be\nthat difficult. It&#39;s pretty easy with Opentype, among others, to\nautomate selection of alternates and ligatures. It would be more work\nfor the designer (I&#39;ve considered taking on the task myself), but none\nat all for the user. In the Latin alphabet, for example, it&#39;s customary\nto replace certain groups of letters with ligatures to make them fit\nmore neatly together. Lowercase &quot;fi&quot; and &quot;fl&quot; will be replaced\nautomatically, if the software supports it, with the ligatures &quot;&#64257;&quot; and\n&quot;&#64258;&quot;. Some fonts provide even more including &quot;ff&quot;, &quot;fj&quot;, &quot;fk&quot; etc., as\nwell as many with a long s instead of f. This kind of replacement is\nused extensively in Arabic because of its cursive nature and works\nperfectly without any user input. You just have to know what sequences\nof letters require what contextual replacements. That&#39;s where it seems\nto get a bit complicated when you have to account for pairs and\ntriplets and so on such that &quot;<font face=\"king plus\">anl</font>&quot; gets\nreplaced with &quot;<font face=\"king plus\">uGl</font>&quot;, but not after\nanother letter that connects on top. But that&#39;s as complicated as it\ngets. And it&#39;s not as bad as it sounds: some of this can be simplified\nby grouping characters into classes according to how they connect on\neach side. Then replacements can be done automatically for each class\nso that everything runs together. If we give them plain-English names\n(I don&#39;t know about other systems, but OpenType generally assigns them\nnumbers), we could call them &quot;top-top&quot;, &quot;top-bottom&quot;, &quot;bottom-top&quot;, and\n&quot;bottom-bottom&quot;. Then write replacements to make sure tops and bottoms\ngo together.<br>\n<br>\nNow, getting software to support these features is another matter.
