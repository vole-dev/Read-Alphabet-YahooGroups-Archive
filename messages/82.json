You can <br/>\nsee the<br/>\n&gt; difference: Junior Quickscriptish, very easy-to-read, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The thing is that there are really three Shavian alphabets: Shavian,<br/>\n&gt; Junior,and Senior.  I think most people who are not adverse to <br/>\ncursive<br/>\n&gt; writing :-) will eventually find Senior the more preferable one for <br/>\npersonal<br/>\n&gt; handwriting, which is the most practical use for a semi-private <br/>\nalphabet<br/>\n&gt; that only a handful of people can read. But for the computer, in <br/>\nEnglish, we<br/>\n&gt; usually only use cursive fonts for art, titles, special emphasis, <br/>\nand the<br/>\n&gt; feeling of a &quot;personal touch.&quot;  On the other hand, many languages <br/>\nof world<br/>\n&gt; use connected, cursive letters: Hindi, Bengali, Arabic, Aramaic.

My only concern is the minor changes to the <br/>\nmapping.  We<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t need three mappings. I think a Read-based mapping is <br/>\ndesireable, but<br/>\n&gt; on the other hand so is backward compatibility to Shavian--not so <br/>\nmuch to<br/>\n&gt; lure them over, but to use their transliteration programs, which is <br/>\nwhy I<br/>\n&gt; kept it in Jerome. (Bad as their mapping is, the fact that they <br/>\ncreated a<br/>\n&gt; standard and built upon it is great.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BTW, I realized that my key to the Second Shaw Alphabet, originally <br/>\nposted<br/>\n&gt; to the Shavian group wasn&#39;t on the files in this group and the <br/>\nShavian&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; copy was corrupted.
