Read invented\n        the letter &quot;lo-CH&quot; to be able to write Scottish names, but given\n        the high frequency of /&#611;/ and /x/ in Dutch I suggest a more\n        versatile character be used.</li>\n      <ul>\n        <li>The &quot;lo-CH&quot; letter always starts &quot;tall&quot; and ends on the\n          lower parallel, which would cause frequent penlifts for Dutch\n          writers.</li>\n        <li>/&#611;/ is most frequently preceded by /&#601;/ and /&#596;&#650;/, and\n          followed by /&#601;/, /r/, /e&#618;/ and /&#618;/.</li>\n        <li>/x/ is most frequently preceded by /&#593;/, /&#603;/ and /s/ (eg. in\n          the infamous word &quot;Scheveningen&quot;), and followed by a /t/ or\n          /r/. The combination /sxr/ (as in &quot;schrijven&quot;) is particularly\n          frequent.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </ul>\n    CONSONANT USE<br>\n    In Dutch, consonants at the end of a word are (almost) always\n    voiceless, even if they stem from (and are written as) a voiced\n    consonant. For example: &quot;bod&quot; /b&#596;t/, &quot;eb&quot; /&#603;p/, &quot;maag&quot; /ma&#720;x/. In\n    English, voiced consonants at word endings are common, as in &quot;stub&quot;,\n    &quot;naked&quot; (and many other words ending with &quot;-ed&quot;), &quot;dig&quot;, &quot;love&quot;,\n    &quot;was&quot; and &quot;page&quot;. This remarkable difference could be taken into\n    consideration. Eg. Read designed is alphabet such that voiced\n    consonants /b/, /d/ and /z/ are particularly easy to write at word\n    endings, using the alternative character for #2, #4 and #12\n    respectively. Note particularly the plural /z/ at the end of many\n    English plurals, eg. &quot;berries&quot;.<br>\n    <br>\n    VOWELS<br>\n    In consonants, there&#39;s enough overlap between Dutch and English to\n    make QuickScript suitable for Dutch without major changes.\n    consonants, so Dutch has a lot more vowels than English. Many of the\n    vowels in English do not occur in Dutch. WhereQuickScript provides\n    us with Depending on who you ask, Dutch has anywhere between 16 and\n    28+ vowels.<br>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Most linguists seem to agree that Dutch has the following\n        monophthongs:<br>\n        /&#618;/ &quot;kip&quot;<br>\n        /i/ &quot;biet&quot;<br>\n        /&#655;/ &quot;hut&quot; <br>\n        /y/ &quot;fuut&quot;<br>\n        /&#601;/ &quot;de&quot;<br>\n        /&#593;/ &quot;bad&quot;<br>\n        /a&#720;/ &quot;zaad&quot;<br>\n        /&#596;/ &quot;bot&quot;<br>\n        /u/ &quot;hoed&quot;</li>\n      <li>Additionally, the following phonemes are considered\n        monophthongs or diphthongs, depending on who you ask and/or\n        where you live.<br>\n        /e&#720;/ &quot;beet&quot;<br>\n        /&oslash;&#720;/ &quot;neus&quot;<br>\n        /o&#720;/ &quot;boot&quot;<br>\n        According to IPA, these are monophthongs. In Belgium, these\n        vowels indeed seem to have this monophthong quality, but in the\n        Netherlands, particularly in the north, these vowels sound more\n        like /e&#618;/, /&oslash;y/ and /&#596;&#650;/ respectively.<br>\n      </li>\n      <li>Then, according to IPA, there are the following diphthongs:<br>\n        /&#603;i/ &quot;ei&quot;<br>\n        /&#339;y/ &quot;ui&quot;<br>\n        /&#652;u/ &quot;zout&quot;<br>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    Apart from these 16 vowels, I hear a lot of other distinct vowel\n    sounds in Dutch. Here my lack of linguistic schooling acts up, but I\n    guess these are generally considered &quot;allophones&quot; of the primary 16\n    vowels, as follows:<br>\n    <ul>\n      <li>/a/ or /&#592;/ &quot;kameel&quot;. an allophone of /a&#720;/, occuring in\n        unstressed syllables.</li>\n      <li>/&#618;:/ &quot;keren&quot;; an allophone of /e&#720;/ &quot;beet&quot;. Both /&#618;:/ and /e&#720;/\n        are considered expressions of the morpheme &quot;lange e&quot; (&quot;long e&quot;).\n        The consonant following the vowel determine which allophone is\n        to be pronounced. Note the difference in meaning between\n        &quot;kirren&quot; /k&#618;r&#601;n/ and &quot;keren&quot; /k&#618;&#720;r&#601;n/.<br>\n      </li>\n      <li>/&#596;&#720;/ &quot;hoor&quot;; an allophone of /o&#720;/ &quot;boot&quot;. Again, the\n        consonant(s) following the vowel determines which allophone is\n        used.</li>\n      <li>/&#655;&#720;/ &quot;keur&quot;; an allophone of /&oslash;&#720;/ &quot;keus&quot;. Again, the\n        consonant(s) following the vowel determines which allophone is\n        used.</li>\n    </ul>\n    Finally, Dutch has a number of vowels that are used rarely, and\n    (almost?) exclusively in French loanwords:<br>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        \n        /&#339;&#720;/ &quot;oeuvre&quot;; also commonly pronounced as /&#655;&#720;/ &quot;keur&quot;.</li>\n      <li>/&#596;~/ &quot;caisson&quot;; almost identical to /&#596;/ &quot;bot&quot;.</li>\n      <li>/&#603;~/ &quot;electricien&quot;; also commonly pronounced as /&#603;n/ &quot;en&quot;<br>\n      </li>\n      <li>/&#593;~/ &quot;restaurant&quot;; almost identical to /&#593;/ &quot;bad&quot;.</li>\n      <li>/&#339;~/ &quot;parfum&quot;.<br>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    After having stared at Read&#39;s solutions to the intricacies of\n    English vowel pronunciation a bit, and after trying to meaningfully\n    map Dutch vowels onto Read&#39;s vowels and corresponding letters, I\n    cannot but decide that Dutch is so much different from English, that\n    it requires a different approach altogether. AFAICS, Read&#39;s original\n    approach, with a purely phonetic spelling and almost completely\n    eliminating multigrams, is simply not feasible for the Dutch\n    language. The number of graphemes required would be inconcievably\n    large.<br>\n    <br>\n    The solution I&#39;d like to propose is to map Dutch _phonemes_ on\n    QuickScript characters, instead of _phones_. From what I&#39;ve read\n    over the last few days, &quot;phonetic vs. phonemic vs. morphemic&quot; is\n    subject of a heated debate among spelling reformers to-be. Read\n    clearly took the &quot;phonetic&quot; point of view, although some of the\n    characters actually seem to represent phonemes rather than phones.\n    I&#39;d like to suggest that we take this a few steps further in the\n    Dutch version of QuickScript. First, I don&#39;t think we have a choice;\n    second, there have been extensive spelling reforms in Dutch already,\n    which already succesfully addressed many of the problems in current\n    English. In these reforms, a morphemic approach seem to have been\n    taken, and this is what Dutch writers are used to already.<br>\n    In fact, I think many Dutch speakers don&#39;t even realize that the\n    &quot;long e&quot; morpheme is pronounced differently in &quot;peer&quot; /p&#618;&#720;r/ and\n    &quot;peen&quot; /pe&#720;n/. To most of us, it just sounds like a &quot;long e&quot;, and it\n    requires careful listening to hear that it can in fact be vocalized\n    in two different ways. I&#39;m convinced that it would be highly\n    counter-intuitive for most Dutch writers if different graphemes be\n    used for _ee_ in &quot;peer&quot; and &quot;peen&quot;.<br>\n    <br>\n    Looking at vowel frequencies, there&#39;s another important difference\n    between English and Dutch: in English, the most frequent phonemes\n    are /&#618;/ (9.9%), /i/ (5.0%), /&#601;/ (3.4%) and /&#593;/ (3.3%). In Dutch, the\n    most frequent morphemes are /&#601;/ (11.7%), /&#593;/ (4.8%), /&#603;/ (3.7%) and\n    /a&#720;/ (3.6%). Percentages depend on what is counted, dialect, corpus\n    etc., but for this discussion any generally accepted frequency\n    distribution suffices, I think.<br>\n    In short, the most frequent Dutch phoneme (/&#601;/) by far is only takes\n    third place in the English frequency distribution. And vice versa,\n    the most common phoneme in English by far (/&#618;/) takes fifth place in\n    the Dutch frequency distribution. This might be taken into\n    consideration when designing a Dutch QuickScript.<br>\n    <br>\n    I&#39;m gonna leave it at this for now. I already have a first version\n    of a new Dutch QuickScript mapping, but I&#39;d rather not release it\n    yet.<br>\n    <br>\n    Best regards,<br>\n    Pieter<br>\n  \n</html></div>",

The number of graph=\r\nemes required would be \ninconcievably large.\n\nThe solution I&#39;d like to prop=\r\nose is to map Dutch _phonemes_ on QuickScript \ncharacters, instead of _phon=\r\nes_. From what I&#39;ve read over the last few days, \n&quot;phonetic vs. phonemic vs=\r\n. morphemic&quot; is subject of a heated debate among \nspelling reformers to-be.=\r\n Read clearly took the &quot;phonetic&quot; point of view, \nalthough some of the char=\r\nacters actually seem to represent phonemes rather \nthan phones. I&#39;d like to=\r\n suggest that we take this a few steps further in \nthe Dutch version of Qui=\r\nckScript. First, I don&#39;t think we have a choice; \nsecond, there have been e=\r\nxtensive spelling reforms in Dutch already, which \nalready succesfully addr=\r\nessed many of the problems in current English. In \nthese reforms, a morphem=\r\nic approach seem to have been taken, and this is \nwhat Dutch writers are us=\r\ned to already.\nIn fact, I think many Dutch speakers don&#39;t even realize that=\r\n the &quot;long e&quot; \nmorpheme is pronounced differently in &quot;peer&quot; /p??r/ and &quot;pee=\r\nn&quot; /pe?n/. To \nmost of us, it just sounds like a &quot;long e&quot;, and it requires =\r\ncareful \nlistening to hear that it can in fact be vocalized in two differen=\r\nt ways. \nI&#39;m convinced that it would be highly counter-intuitive for most D=\r\nutch \nwriters if different graphemes be used for _ee_ in &quot;peer&quot; and &quot;peen&quot;.=\r\n\n\nLooking at vowel frequencies, there&#39;s another important difference betwee=\r\nn \nEnglish and Dutch: in English, the most frequent phonemes are /?/ (9.9%)=\r\n, \n/i/ (5.0%), /?/ (3.4%) and /?/ (3.3%). In Dutch, the most frequent morph=\r\nemes \nare /?/ (11.7%), /?/ (4.8%), /?/ (3.7%) and /a?/ (3.6%). Percentages =\r\ndepend \non what is counted, dialect, corpus etc., but for this discussion a=\r\nny \ngenerally accepted frequency distribution suffices, I think.\nIn short, =\r\nthe most frequent Dutch phoneme (/?/) by far is only takes third \nplace in =\r\nthe English frequency distribution. And vice versa, the most common \nphonem=\r\ne in English by far (/?/) takes fifth place in the Dutch frequency \ndistrib=\r\nution. This might be taken into consideration when designing a Dutch \nQuick=\r\nScript.\n\nI&#39;m gonna leave it at this for now. I already have a first version=\r\n of a new \nDutch QuickScript mapping, but I&#39;d rather not release it yet.\n\nB=\r\nest regards,\nPieter\n\r\n--------------000204020704050904080707\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n\n    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; text=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;\n    Dear all,&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    I&#39;m in the process of adapting QuickScript for Dutch. I&#39;m aware that\n    one participant in this group has proposed a Dutch version of\n    QuickScript, but uhm, IMNSHO, it could do with a little improvement.&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    Since I&#39;m not a linguist, I thought it would be a good idea to write\n    down my findings and opinions early, and hopefully get some valuable\n    feedback from the group.&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n    Pieter (pronounced /pit&#601;r/)&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    CONSONANTS FREQUENCIES&lt;br&gt;\n    There is a number of remarkable differences is consonant frequencies\n    that I think should be taken into consideration.&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Dutch completely lacks the English /&#952;/, /&eth;/ and // w(#7 and\n        #8).&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;The phonemes /g/, /&#643;/, /t&#643;/, and /d&#658;/ (#6, #13, #15 and #16),\n        while common in English, are rare in Dutch, occuring almost\n        exclusively in loanwords, as in &quot;goal&quot;, &quot;shock&quot;, &quot;check&quot; and\n        &quot;gel&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;The phoneme /&#658;/ (#14) seems to be rare in both languages. In\n        Dutch it only occurs in loanwords, like &quot;journaal&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;English completely lacks phonemes /&#611;/ and /x/ (which are very\n        common in Dutch and make us sound like Klingons. Read invented\n        the letter &quot;lo-CH&quot; to be able to write Scottish names, but given\n        the high frequency of /&#611;/ and /x/ in Dutch I suggest a more\n        versatile character be used.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;ul&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;The &quot;lo-CH&quot; letter always starts &quot;tall&quot; and ends on the\n          lower parallel, which would cause frequent penlifts for Dutch\n          writers.&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;/&#611;/ is most frequently preceded by /&#601;/ and /&#596;&#650;/, and\n          followed by /&#601;/, /r/, /e&#618;/ and /&#618;/.&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;/x/ is most frequently preceded by /&#593;/, /&#603;/ and /s/ (eg. in\n          the infamous word &quot;Scheveningen&quot;), and followed by a /t/ or\n          /r/. The combination /sxr/ (as in &quot;schrijven&quot;) is particularly\n          frequent.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    CONSONANT USE&lt;br&gt;\n    In Dutch, consonants at the end of a word are (almost) always\n    voiceless, even if they stem from (and are written as) a voiced\n    consonant. For example: &quot;bod&quot; /b&#596;t/, &quot;eb&quot; /&#603;p/, &quot;maag&quot; /ma&#720;x/. In\n    English, voiced consonants at word endings are common, as in &quot;stub&quot;,\n    &quot;naked&quot; (and many other words ending with &quot;-ed&quot;), &quot;dig&quot;, &quot;love&quot;,\n    &quot;was&quot; and &quot;page&quot;. This remarkable difference could be taken into\n    consideration. Eg. Read designed is alphabet such that voiced\n    consonants /b/, /d/ and /z/ are particularly easy to write at word\n    endings, using the alternative character for #2, #4 and #12\n    respectively. Note particularly the plural /z/ at the end of many\n    English plurals, eg. &quot;berries&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    VOWELS&lt;br&gt;\n    In consonants, there&#39;s enough overlap between Dutch and English to\n    make QuickScript suitable for Dutch without major changes.\n    consonants, so Dutch has a lot more vowels than English. Many of the\n    vowels in English do not occur in Dutch. WhereQuickScript provides\n    us with Depending on who you ask, Dutch has anywhere between 16 and\n    28+ vowels.&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Most linguists seem to agree that Dutch has the following\n        monophthongs:&lt;br&gt;\n        /&#618;/ &quot;kip&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n        /i/ &quot;biet&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n        /&#655;/ &quot;hut&quot; &lt;br&gt;\n        /y/ &quot;fuut&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n        /&#601;/ &quot;de&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n        /&#593;/ &quot;bad&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n        /a&#720;/ &quot;zaad&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n        /&#596;/ &quot;bot&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n        /u/ &quot;hoed&quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Additionally, the following phonemes are considered\n        monophthongs or diphthongs, depending on who you ask and/or\n        where you live.&lt;br&gt;\n        /e&#720;/ &quot;beet&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n        /&oslash;&#720;/ &quot;neus&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n        /o&#720;/ &quot;boot&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n        According to IPA, these are monophthongs. In Belgium, these\n        vowels indeed seem to have this monophthong quality, but in the\n        Netherlands, particularly in the north, these vowels sound more\n        like /e&#618;/, /&oslash;y/ and /&#596;&#650;/ respectively.&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Then, according to IPA, there are the following diphthongs:&lt;br&gt;\n        /&#603;i/ &quot;ei&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n        /&#339;y/ &quot;ui&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n        /&#652;u/ &quot;zout&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    Apart from these 16 vowels, I hear a lot of other distinct vowel\n    sounds in Dutch. Here my lack of linguistic schooling acts up, but I\n    guess these are generally considered &quot;allophones&quot; of the primary 16\n    vowels, as follows:&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;/a/ or /&#592;/ &quot;kameel&quot;. an allophone of /a&#720;/, occuring in\n        unstressed syllables.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;/&#618;:/ &quot;keren&quot;; an allophone of /e&#720;/ &quot;beet&quot;. Both /&#618;:/ and /e&#720;/\n        are considered expressions of the morpheme &quot;lange e&quot; (&quot;long e&quot;).\n        The consonant following the vowel determine which allophone is\n        to be pronounced. Note the difference in meaning between\n        &quot;kirren&quot; /k&#618;r&#601;n/ and &quot;keren&quot; /k&#618;&#720;r&#601;n/.&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;/&#596;&#720;/ &quot;hoor&quot;; an allophone of /o&#720;/ &quot;boot&quot;. Again, the\n        consonant(s) following the vowel determines which allophone is\n        used.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;/&#655;&#720;/ &quot;keur&quot;; an allophone of /&oslash;&#720;/ &quot;keus&quot;. Again, the\n        consonant(s) following the vowel determines which allophone is\n        used.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    Finally, Dutch has a number of vowels that are used rarely, and\n    (almost?) exclusively in French loanwords:&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\n        /&#339;&#720;/ &quot;oeuvre&quot;; also commonly pronounced as /&#655;&#720;/ &quot;keur&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;/&#596;~/ &quot;caisson&quot;; almost identical to /&#596;/ &quot;bot&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;/&#603;~/ &quot;electricien&quot;; also commonly pronounced as /&#603;n/ &quot;en&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;/&#593;~/ &quot;restaurant&quot;; almost identical to /&#593;/ &quot;bad&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;/&#339;~/ &quot;parfum&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    After having stared at Read&#39;s solutions to the intricacies of\n    English vowel pronunciation a bit, and after trying to meaningfully\n    map Dutch vowels onto Read&#39;s vowels and corresponding letters, I\n    cannot but decide that Dutch is so much different from English, that\n    it requires a different approach altogether. AFAICS, Read&#39;s original\n    approach, with a purely phonetic spelling and almost completely\n    eliminating multigrams, is simply not feasible for the Dutch\n    language.
