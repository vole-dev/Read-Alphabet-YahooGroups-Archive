  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1055528730\">&nbsp;&nbsp; While reading Paige&#39;s message about standardized spelling, I thought about how English-speaking folks lived without it back during the Renaissance period.&nbsp; I myself am reading Edmund Spenser&#39;s <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\nFaerie Queene</span> (1590) right now, and even though there are no J&#39;s, and V&#39;s and U&#39;s change depending on whether the letter appears at the beginning of a word, I am not having any trouble reading it, even with the irregularity of spelling.\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; What I think more than anything will prove what we&#39;re talking about (not proving that someone&#39;s right or wrong, but testing the situation itself) is actual usage.&nbsp; Were someone to start a periodical in Quickscript as discussed earlier, with contributors from varying locations, it seems to me that the only concern for the materials would be that they actually \n<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">do</span> match the spoken language, and are not just errors made from thinking in traditional orthography.&nbsp; We can talk all day long about how things <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">could\n</span> be, but the only thing that matters is how things are or will<span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> </span>be in actuality.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">-Benjamin Bruce<br></span>BenjaminBruce.com<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">\n<br></span><br><div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1055528730gmail_quote\">2007/9/10, pgabhart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pgabhart@...\">pgabhart@...</a>&gt;:</span><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-1055528730gmail_quote\" style=\"border-left:1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n\n\n<div style=\"width:655px;\">\n  <div style=\"padding:0pt 15px 0pt 0pt;width:490px;float:left;\">\n\n\n    <div>\n            <p>First, I disagree with the statement &quot;QS is meant to be heard.&quot;  Not <br>\nmeaning to be categorical, but QS is an attempt to realign English with <br>\nan alphabet that works the way an alphabet is supposed to:  one sound = <br>\none phoneme.  The QS manual starts off with the reasons why trying to <br>\nredesign the Roman alphabet just doesn&#39;t cut it.  A new alphabet was needed.<br>\n<br>\nThe problem I see with standardized spelling is that the <br>\n&quot;English-speaking Peoples&quot; have no language academy to even attempt to <br>\nenforce spelling changes as the language continues to evolve.  That is <br>\nsort of how we got in this mess (TO) to begin with. <br>\n<br>\nI may be abysmally ignorant of the extent of English dialects, but I <br>\nsuspect that for a very large majority of English speakers, i.e. the <br>\nones clustered in the middle of the bell curve of English pronunciation, <br>\nwe could get along just fine without a standardized spelling because the <br>\nmajority of the words we use on a daily basis are not going to be spelt <br>\nso peculiarly by someone from a different, but still one of the major <br>\nspeech communities that it would not be recognizable.  To be sure, there <br>\nare the outliers on that bell curve who would need to conform their <br>\nspeech to a dialect in broader use than their own such as they would <br>\nhear on the BBC or from American news outlets.  But for most of us, I <br>\ndoubt we would need spelling police.  For example, if I write &quot;schedule&quot; <br>\nwith a &quot;k&quot; sound, and a Londoner reads it, I seriously doubt, he would <br>\nhave more than a moment&#39;s hesitation in deciphering the word even though <br>\nhe doesn&#39;t pronounce it that way.<br>\n<br>\nIf we start insisting that every word must be spelt in accordance with <br>\nan arbitrary standard that does not match anyone&#39;s speech completely, <br>\nthen we will be back to looking up many words and memorizing their <br>\nspelling.  It is my understanding that in Shakespeare&#39;s time, the idea <br>\nof proper spelling did not exist, and the Bard was quite content to <br>\nspell a word one way today and differently tomorrow.  That apparently <br>\ndidn&#39;t hold him back  We all have been prejudiced by our schooling and <br>\nwhat Kingsley Read called the &quot;cultural fetish&quot; of spelling to reject <br>\nthe idea that we can spell words the way we want.  If we go too far <br>\nastray, our readers won&#39;t understand, and we pay the price of not being <br>\nread.  That by itself, forces a high level of conformism onto the <br>\nsituation, but to insist that we all have to spell in lockstep or be <br>\nconsidered morons is quite a different matter.<br>\n<br>\nI have seen a number of people insist that we have to have standardized <br>\nspelling or we are doomed, but I doubt anyone has actually studied this <br>\nso we have no real data as to how an alternative English alphabet would <br>\nwork if it did or did not use standardized spelling.  For example, let <br>\nus assume that we don&#39;t insist on standardized spelling and that it was <br>\nlater found that that decision slowed the average reading speed by 5 or <br>\n10 % (I doubt it would be any greater than that).  Would that not be a <br>\nreasonable price to pay to avoid putting ourselves back in the position <br>\nof attempting to memorize how words should be spelt rather than spelling <br>\nthem the way they sound in speech?  I believe it would, especially for <br>\nthe dyslexics among us, who cannot deal with arbitrary spellings.<br>\n<br>\nIf a person occasionally is unsure how to spell a word because he <br>\nsuspects he may pronounce it differently than others, he could always <br>\nlook it up in a dictionary.  This is better than trying to memorize the <br>\nspelling of virtually his entire vocabulary in order to have it comply <br>\nwith an arbitrary standard of speech.<br>\n<br>\nPaige<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1055528730q\"><br>\n<br>\nJohn Cowan wrote:<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt; amd64_hacker scripsit:<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt; &gt; Personally I&#39;m for abbreviations in all texts.<br>\n&gt; &gt; It seems to me that since QS is meant to be &#39;heard&#39; it shouldn&#39;t matter<br>\n&gt; &gt; how the word is written but how it is read.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt; Well, yes, but that slows down reading to the speed of speech. I suspect<br>\n&gt; that rapid silent reading and standardized orthography go together --<br>\n&gt; we do know that fluent readers recognize familiar words by the total<br>\n&gt; shape of the word, slowing down only when they must to read an unfamilar<br>\n&gt; word, and that this is equally true in languages that are rationally<br>\n&gt; spelled, irrationally spelled, or not spelled at all (like Chinese).<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt; So if QS is going to become important for works meant to be read<br>\n&gt; more than once (as opposed to shorthand/transcription uses), a<br>\n&gt; standardized orthography will have to evolve.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt; Which immediately leads to the issue of dialects. One&#39;s obvious and<br>\n&gt; natural phonetic orthography is another&#39;s stumbling block. (&quot;Hmm,<br>\n&gt; is it spelled &#39;theft&#39; or &#39;feft&#39;?&quot; &quot;Hmm, does this mean &#39;lord&#39; or<br>\n&gt; &#39;laud&#39;?&quot;) A universal orthography ends up needing to make more <br>\n&gt; distinctions<br>\n&gt; than any one dialect actually needs, and thus to some extent becoming<br>\n&gt; artificial to all.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt; -- <br></span>\n&gt; John Cowan <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cowan%40ccil.org\">cowan@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cowan%25\">\ncowan%</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">40ccil.org</a>&gt;<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1055528730q\"><br>\n&gt; &quot;Mr. Lane, if you ever wish anything that I can do, all you will have<br>\n&gt; to do will be to send me a telegram asking and it will be done.&quot;<br>\n&gt; &quot;Mr. Hearst, if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do<br>\n&gt; anything, you can put the telegram down as a forgery.&quot;<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;  <br>\n<br>\n</span></p>\n    </div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1055528730q\">  \n\n    \n    <span style=\"color:white;\"></span>\n\n</span></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></div>\n</div>",
