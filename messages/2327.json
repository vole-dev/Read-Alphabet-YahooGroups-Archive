But if we are correcting centuries of pronunciation drift, \nthen the game seems worth the candle to me.  Must English speakers \nalways be in such a rush that maintaining the average reading speed \ntrumps the time and effort spent learning to read a script that has \napproximately six times the exceptions to its own spelling rules that, \nfor example, Italian has?  If that is the case, we are doomed to \ncontinue treating &quot;correct&quot; spelling as a cultural fetish as Kingsley \nRead called it.  How can we ever improve the situation?\n\nFurthermore, once one has seen an atypical, but more accurate spelling a \nfew times, it would start to look familiar and stop slowing the reader \ndown.  One problem now is that most peoples are intimidated by the \ndesire to not appear as incompetent spellers. Spelling mistakes are seen \nas a sign of poor education when, in fact, it is a sign of being able to \nmemorize a large amount of illogical bits of information.  People end up \nafraid to make even modest changes to traditional spelling.  Hence, your \nuse of &quot;(sic)&quot; in your response.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Another point is that English seems peculiarly resistant to modification\n&gt; &gt; of standardized spelling over time when pronunciation has changed as\n&gt; &gt; compared to other languages such as German or Spanish.\n&gt;\n&gt; True enough. It took ten years for four countries to reform German\n&gt; spelling in 1996, and there is still plenty of resistance. English\n&gt; is official in at least fifty countries, and it would probably take\n&gt; a hundred years for a similar modest reform effort to bear fruit.\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t have that long to wait.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have not gone back and checked the group messages from the past,\n&gt; &gt; but I remember long detailed discussions about how necessary\n&gt; &gt; standardizing QS spelling was. The people pushing this idea seem\n&gt; &gt; much more focused on this than seems necessary to me, and they\n&gt; &gt; seemed very adamant about it.\n&gt;\n&gt; The issue arises when Alice, who distinguishes between the Ox, Ah, and\n&gt; Awe sounds, is trying to read QS written by Bob, who doesn&#39;t. It would\n&gt; be like trying to figure out what someone means by &quot;There&#39;s a lot of\n&gt; feft in my area&quot; when you have never heard of Estuary English.\n&gt;\n\nThis strikes me to some extent similar to an American trying to figure \nout the meaning of &quot;lorry&quot; or &quot;lift&quot;  Somehow, we Yanks tend to get by.  \nI suspect that most readers can figure out the meaning of &quot;feft&quot; from \nthe context.  Altho it also strikes me that an Estuary English speaker \nreading &quot;theft&quot; in print should recognize their pronunciation is a \ndramatic shift from the past.  Unless we suppose they are slowed down in \ntheir reading by this unfamiliar word beginning with &quot;th.&quot;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The idea of the existence of &quot;silent&quot; letters brings this out. A\n&gt; &gt; couple of years ago I learned of an elementary teacher who was telling\n&gt; &gt; her young students that the &quot;h&quot; in words such as &quot;which&quot; and &quot;why&quot; was\n&gt; &gt; a silent letter. Presumably, for her it was, but I suspect she had no\n&gt; &gt; idea that many people still pronounce it and consider it important.\n&gt;\n&gt; Relatively few people in fact still distinguish between &quot;whine&quot; and \n&gt; &quot;wine&quot;.\n&gt; Outside Scotland, Ireland, and parts of the American South, this \n&gt; merger has\n&gt; gone to completion, though people who do not have the merger often believe\n&gt; that they hear it in other people&#39;s speech even when it isn&#39;t there.\n&gt;\n\nA Wikipedia article states that 17% of the U.S. public still \ndistinguishes &quot;wh&quot; from &quot;w&quot; to some extent.  If this is correct, that \nrepresents roughly 50-55 million people (not even counting the Irish and \nScottish), which is close to the population of England.  I hardly find \nthat &quot;relatively few people.&quot;  I would also note that Read decided to \ninclude the sound in QS after ignoring it in Shavian.\n\n&gt; &gt; No wonder it is a dying sound with that lack of knowledge on the part\n&gt; &gt; of the people teaching our children.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you have hold the wrong end of the stick. It&#39;s because the\n&gt; distinction is dead in most places, dying in some, that many people\n&gt; don&#39;t know it&#39;s still alive anywhere.\n&gt;\n\nIf spelling matched pronunciation, when you received a written message \nfrom someone who still distinguishes &quot;wh&quot; from &quot;w,&quot; you would no doubt \nnotice it.  (wy vs. why)  As it is, we teach children to include the &quot;h&quot; \nand then tell them it serves no purpose and is not pronounced.  Might as \nwell stick a &quot;z&quot; in the word for additional weirdness.\n\nBy the way, which end of the stick do people have who speak a non-rhotic \naccent.  Every time I hear a BBC newsreader say &quot;Chiner&quot; or &quot;Obamer&quot; \nfollowed by &quot;China&quot; or &quot;Obama&quot; in the next sentence I am distracted from \nthe news they are reading.\n\nPaige\n\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; John Cowan cowan@... &lt;mailto:cowan%40ccil.org&gt;&gt; \n&gt; http://www.ccil.org/~cowan &lt;http://www.ccil.org/%7Ecowan&gt;\n&gt; Sir, I quite agree with you, but what are we two against so many?\n&gt; --George Bernard Shaw,\n&gt; to a man booing at the opening of _Arms and the Man_\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n-- \n&quot;Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery.&quot; --- Winston Churchill\n\n\n\r\n--------------040608010108070707020400\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1&quot;\n      http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; text=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;moz-cite-prefix&quot;&gt;On 2/21/2013 4:41 PM, John Cowan wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote cite=&quot;mid:20130221214102.GE21153@...&quot;\n      type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n      \n          &lt;div id=&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; I would argue that if it is clear what word you are&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; intending to represent, a slightly different spelling\n              from an&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; arbitrary &quot;standard&quot; should cause no difficulty in\n              reading.&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n              Studies show that an unexpected misspelling does in fact\n              slow down&lt;br&gt;\n              reading, even tho [sic] it may itself represent an\n              improovement [sic].&lt;br&gt;\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n    No doubt an atypical spelling causes some reduction in reading speed\n    momentarily.&nbsp; But if we are correcting centuries of pronunciation\n    drift, then the game seems worth the candle to me.&nbsp; Must English\n    speakers always be in such a rush that maintaining the average\n    reading speed trumps the time and effort spent learning to read a\n    script that has approximately six times the exceptions to its own\n    spelling rules that, for example, Italian has?&nbsp; If that is the case,\n    we are doomed to continue treating &quot;correct&quot; spelling as a cultural\n    fetish as Kingsley Read called it.&nbsp; How can we ever improve the\n    situation?&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    Furthermore, once one has seen an atypical, but more accurate\n    spelling a few times, it would start to look familiar and stop\n    slowing the reader down.&nbsp; One problem now is that most peoples are\n    intimidated by the desire to not appear as incompetent spellers.&nbsp;\n    Spelling mistakes are seen as a sign of poor education when, in\n    fact, it is a sign of being able to memorize a large amount of\n    illogical bits of information.&nbsp; People end up afraid to make even\n    modest changes to traditional spelling.&nbsp; Hence, your use of &quot;(sic)&quot;\n    in your response.&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote cite=&quot;mid:20130221214102.GE21153@...&quot;\n      type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;div id=&quot;ygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div id=&quot;ygrp-msg&quot; style=&quot;z-index: 1;&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;div id=&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; Another point is that English seems peculiarly\n              resistant to modification&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; of standardized spelling over time when pronunciation\n              has changed as&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; compared to other languages such as German or\n              Spanish.&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n              True enough.
