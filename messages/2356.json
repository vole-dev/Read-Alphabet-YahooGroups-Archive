If you&#39;re from Ontario, then I&#39;m guessing that your pronunciation is extremely similar to mine in California. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe vowel which letter #33 represents is basically the same as for #32, except that with #33 you&#39;re also rounding your lips. (Most people don&#39;t realize that.) The sound of letter #33 occurs frequently in Britain, as well as New York / New Jersey / New England. In my pronunciation the #33 never occurs at all, as it&#39;s totally replaced by #32. In my speaking the sound of #34 is also almost completely replaced by #32; I have the #32 sound only before an &quot;l&quot; or an &quot;r&quot;, and in dipthongs (in which case it&#39;s not written in QS, of course, since it has specific letters for diphthongs). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just want to encourage you to look carefully at those, regardless of what conclusions you reach.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind Regards, <br/>\n<br/>\nScott</div>",
