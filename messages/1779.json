I have always somewhat leaned towards a standardized spelling, <br/>\nbut others have spoken out against it, so I guess you have the problem <br/>\nof convincing the group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The reason for not distinguishing THOUGHT from LOT is<br/>\n&gt; mainly that<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My dictionary makes the distinction between THOUGHT and LOT.

Merging the three sets allows everyone to spell<br/>\n&gt; CLOTH words the same way. (There is of course a third<br/>\n&gt; group of accents where all three sets have /A/ -- the<br/>\n&gt; uniform spelling with {Q} will be a simplification for<br/>\n&gt; them too.)<br/>\n&gt; - the functional load[^2] of the LOT-THOUGHT distinction<br/>\n&gt; is low in those accents which make it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Being an American speaker, I can&#39;t hear the CLOTH set at all, but this <br/>\nseems to make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The TRAP and FATHER sets are also not distinguished, since<br/>\n&gt; the functional load of that distinction is small, and is<br/>\n&gt; missing for many speakers in the North of England, Scotland<br/>\n&gt; and Northern Ireland, not to mention many ESL speakers.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately with my dictionary, you can&#39;t simply merge these two sets <br/>\nlater. If you do a simple replacement where {A} gets changed to {a}, you <br/>\nwould change words like {TAt} to {Tat}. So I guess here our efforts on <br/>\nmaking a dictionary merge.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; An exception is made for the START and NORTH-FORCE sets for<br/>\n&gt; two reasons:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - These sets are pronounced with /A/ and /O/ respectively<br/>\n&gt; in all major accents of English, and<br/>\n&gt; - The QS combinations {Qr} and {ar} are awkward to write<br/>\n&gt; compared to {Or} and {Ar} (although IMO {O} and {A} are<br/>\n&gt; more difficult to write than {Q} and {a} in many other<br/>\n&gt; contexts).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For my accent (and I think all others), I think of the /Or/ in FORCE and <br/>\nthe /Ar/ in START as unique combinations; we hear the vowel and the _r_ <br/>\nas one sound, or think of it as such, so I see no problem with this <br/>\nexception.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I were to base an inter-English spelling reform on some<br/>\n&gt; another alphabet than QS I might also merge STRUT-FOOT or<br/>\n&gt; even all of STRUT-FOOT- GOOSE, but Read&#39;s grounds for using<br/>\n&gt; the letter {y} as he did, for both /V/ and /y/ and with {yr}<br/>\n&gt; for /3(r)/ were quite solid, and after all most speakers of<br/>\n&gt; English do distinguish STRUT from FOOT, so I see no pressing<br/>\n&gt; need deviate from Read&#39;s practice in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I am not so certain that Read&#39;s decision was based on solid <br/>\ngrounds. The {y} has to serve for /3/, /V/, and /y/. In my opinion this <br/>\nleads to confusion, as I have discussed before, when reading words like <br/>\n_arrest_ and _urge_, spelled respectively {yrEst} and {yrJ}. Both words <br/>\nstart with {yr}, but the first words is pronounced /yr/, while the <br/>\nsecond is pronounced /3r/, and those sounds are very different for me, <br/>\nand make me have to re-read the word to get its sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover, I don&#39;t know if Read himself thought this a wise decision. He <br/>\ndevised 3 alphabets in his life time, the Shavian script, the <br/>\nQuikscript, and Readspel. QS came in the middle of those two alphabets. <br/>\nIn Readspell, which came last and Read finished a few days before his <br/>\ndeath, Read put both /V/ and /3r/ back into his alphabet.
