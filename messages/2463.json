At that time, he had recently moved to Louisville, \nKentucky near where I live.  We never met in person.  He was very \nenthusiastic about QS and designed the Thoth font soon after becoming a \nmember.  I provided a modest amount of assistance in reviewing his \ninitial font design and making some suggestions to him.\n\nPaul set up the daily news in QS, which took AP news releases and \ntransliterated them into QS.  It was useful in providing timely QS \nreadings for reading practice.  When he was unable to continue doing \nthat, the news disappeared.  It would be nice to see it come back as \nlack of reading material is one of the major stumbling blocks which keep \npeople from increasing their reading speed.\n\nIn December, 2007, he was working on a QS dictionary and a number of \nposts were sent between Paul and Benct Philip Jonsson who was also \nworking on a dictionary proposal at that time.\n\nHe asked for someone to take over the news on 1/14/08 because he did not \nhave the time to continue it.  His last post was only 2 days later.  \nSince then we have not heard from him.  He is not currently a member of \nthe group as far as I am aware.\n\nThere is no particular reason to view the letter names he used as canonical.\n\nRegards,\n\n\nPaige\n\n\n\nOn 4/22/2013 10:23 AM, John Cowan wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Michael Everson scripsit:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Who is Tremblay and why should we care?\n&gt;\n&gt; Paul H.
