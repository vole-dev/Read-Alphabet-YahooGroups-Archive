The images I made above<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  for Fig 1. is certainly totally inadequate and is really only usable<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  for a couple accents. Far more lexical sets would have to be able to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  move to other letters.

If this were<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  possible, people with the same accent would use different letters in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  spelling the same word. Each *person* maybe consistent but within the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  accent there would be wide variation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Issue 3:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Complexity: Lexical set use is going to be harder to explain than a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  static IPA map.
