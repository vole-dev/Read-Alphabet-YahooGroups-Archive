  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-832765659\">There has, in the past, been discussion of the connectivity of any <br/>\npotential new writing system for English.  I&#39;d pointed out the high <br/>\nconnectivity of the Arabic writing system, and someone suggested that <br/>\nif it&#39;s so connective, why not use it to write English?  I&#39;d thought <br/>\nabout it, and later set out on a quest to adapt the Arabic writing <br/>\nsystem so that English can be written with it.  I gave up on it a <br/>\nwhile back, but I found a quite suitable font, the perfect one for <br/>\nthis project.  I&#39;ve since then completed my table of Arabic letters, <br/>\nand how they&#39;d be used to write the sounds of English.  I&#39;d be glad <br/>\nto post it (and the font required to view it) in the &#39;Files&#39; section <br/>\nshould anyone request it.  I also have a sample of &#39;Nothing Gold Can <br/>\nStay&#39; in my Arabic adaptation.  Anyway, I&#39;ve just finished updating <br/>\nit, so I believe it&#39;s at its best stage so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone think it would be a suitable writing system for English?  <br/>\nIf some do not like the fact that it&#39;s written right-to-left, the <br/>\nletters can easily be reversed and be written left-to-right.  Also, <br/>\ndo you think many people could get used to the fact that most <br/>\nconsonants are differentiated from the others by dots, and used to <br/>\nwriting diacritics as vowels?  Or reading/writing without diacritics?<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: In my adaptation, ah, ee, oh, and oo are always indicated as <br/>\nletters, and I, ow, ay, and oi are always indicated (either as a <br/>\nletter/diacritic combination, or as two letters).  The short vowels <br/>\n(the ones not mentioned above; ae, eh, ih, aw, o, uh, eu) would be <br/>\nindicated as diacritics, or not at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also the issue of how people of Middle Eastern descent would <br/>\nlook at a change like this, but I won&#39;t get into that.  If someone <br/>\nwants to comment on it, however, go right ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet back to me with your responses and questions.</div>",
