You&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; mentioned that a &quot;properly set up computer&quot; should display all\nthree&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; tests properly. What is your definition of a &quot;properly set up&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; computer&quot;? Do you think if my computer was &quot;properly set up&quot; it\nwould&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; display the first and second tests correctly?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; When I copied the third tests and pasted it into Word Perfect, as\nlong&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as the font was set to &quot;Kingsley,&quot; it displayed correctly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Regarding spelling: I have always heard &quot;ASCII&quot; pronounced as\n&quot;Askey&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; What you wrote I would transliterate as &quot;uski (last letter short-i,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; rather than a long e sound.).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for the test.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Paige&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; amd64_hacker wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I had further thoughts on point 1, I realise that &#39;it works\nfor me&#39;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; probably wasn&#39;t the most helpful comment.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve created a page which tests three methods of displaying\nQS text in a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; browser.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The methods are:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Unicode + Font hints.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Unicode on it&#39;s own.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ASCII + Font hints.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The first is the best compromise, the text is Unicode but we\ntell the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; browser which font to use which solves the collision problem.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The second is the &#39;correct&#39; method since it doesn&#39;t require\nparticular&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; fonts to be installed or special mark up but it&#39;s also the\nmost likely&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to fail due to code point collisions in the PUA. :(&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The third method should display correctly in just about any\nbrowser but&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; if you copy the text you&#39;ll get the underlying ascii/latin\ntext.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ideally all three tests should display the same text on a\nproperly setup&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; computer.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the real world if we can find a method which works for\nmost people&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; then we use that to talk to each other.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to apologise for the spelling on the page, my\nability to write&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; in QS is not very good yet.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve uploaded the test page to the Fonts folder, please let\nme know if&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; you have any ideas/suggestions/&lt;wbr&gt;improvements.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--------------040905000600010708050809--\r\n\n"
