I am an attorney and am used to debating my point of view<br/>\n&gt; (or my client&#39;s)  Many people seem to find the expression of a difference of<br/>\n&gt; opinion as somehow objectionable, but wouldn&#39;t it be a boring world if we were all<br/>\n&gt; required to hold to the same beliefs.

Russ DeMeyere&#39;s Shavian website quotes a letter<br/>\n&gt; from the Public Trustee which states:  &quot;Shaw imposed on his trustees the duty of<br/>\n&gt; seeking and publishing a more efficient alphabet of at least forty letters than<br/>\n&gt; the existing one of twenty-six letters to enable &#39;the said language to be written<br/>\n&gt; without indicating single sounds by groups of letters or by diacritical<br/>\n&gt; marks&#39;...in the end a design by Mr. Kingsley Read was adopted to fulfill this and<br/>\n&gt; other terms of Bernard Shaw&#39;s will.&quot;  (see www.demeyere.com/Shavian/info.html)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Star Raven wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I read somewhere that the final shaw alphabet was a conglomeration of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; four designs to create the finished product, I never said shaw did it,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it was the money in HIS will.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When Read developed Quikscript, he dropped the two separate characters for  the<br/>\n&gt; pairs &quot;Err&quot; and &quot;Array&quot; and &quot;Up&quot; and &quot;Ado&quot; which appeared in Shavian.  This was<br/>\n&gt; done after extensive correspondence in Shavian between English speaking countries<br/>\n&gt; around the world.  I assume he decided that the distinction was not as clear as he<br/>\n&gt; first thought it was from his British perspective, and that it added a needless<br/>\n&gt; complexity to the alphabet.  On the other hand, he added &quot;Wh&quot; to Quikscript, which<br/>\n&gt; he learned many people still do distinguish and feel quite strongly about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have not followed the discussion closely regarding stress, but if that is the<br/>\n&gt; primary distinction between &quot;Ado&quot; and &quot;Up&quot; and &quot;Array&quot; and &quot;Err&quot;, then I believe<br/>\n&gt; Read was correct in dropping the &quot;stressed&quot; characters.  I have been using<br/>\n&gt; Quikscript for over twenty-five years, and I have never missed &quot;Err&quot; or &quot;Up&quot;.  In<br/>\n&gt; fact, I was not sure what sounds they were supposed to represent as I could not<br/>\n&gt; hear any distinction in the way I pronounced the applicable words.  It had never<br/>\n&gt; occurred to me that the difference was supposedly one of stress.  My reaction is<br/>\n&gt; that certain vowels will be stressed as a result of where they appear in a given<br/>\n&gt; word  and as a result of the consonants surrounding them.  We do not have other<br/>\n&gt; letters whose only difference is stress, and I do not think stress should be<br/>\n&gt; represented by a different character in the alphabet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The dictionary I have here at home is Webster&#39;s Ninth New Collegiate.  I looked up<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Ado&quot;, &quot;Up&quot;, &quot;Array&quot; and &quot;Err&quot;, and the opening vowel sound of all four words is<br/>\n&gt; represented by a schwa.  The difference in stress is shown by an accent, not by a<br/>\n&gt; different phonetic symbol.  The word &quot;abut&quot;, which Hugh recently mentioned in a<br/>\n&gt; post as needing &quot;Up&quot;, rather than &quot;Ado&quot; for its second vowel is also listed with a<br/>\n&gt; schwa.  Thus, I find no reason to suppose that Read somehow needlessly simplified<br/>\n&gt; Quikscript&#39;s ability to accurately represent English.  And I have to respectfully<br/>\n&gt; disagree with you that these are separate and distinct sounds.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ado and Up are distinct sounds as are Err and Array.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quickscript combines err and array which makes it harder to express<br/>\n&gt; &gt; certain things, IMHO.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Peace,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Star<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Having been unpopular in high school is not just cause for book publications.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Frank Lebowitz<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
