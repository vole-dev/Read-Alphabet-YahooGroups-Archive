But most of my English writing is still in Latin<br/>\nletters, because most of my writing is communication with other<br/>\npeople! I find it especially sad to write in Latin letters even when I<br/>\nwrite to other people who like Quikscript!<br/>\nI would love to use Quikscript for communication with people instead<br/>\nof just writing to myself. Would anybody here be interested in having<br/>\na written-in-Quikscript mailing list or newsletter or IRC channel? I<br/>\nthink this would be something really interesting, fun, and helpful for<br/>\nthe movement in general. I think there would be lots of things we<br/>\ncould talk about while writing in QS. And we would use the orthography<br/>\nin practice, see how things look, how things feel, how easy it is for<br/>\ninternational speakers to understand each other.<br/>\ncheers,<br/>\nJack</div>",
