That&#39;s pretty neat if you do!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you are not understanding my proposal.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I think Kingsely Read&#39;s methods of describing the sounds of words<br/>\nby using other words is confusing and not very helpful. He pronounced<br/>\nwords one way, but we all pronounce them differently. If I am correct,<br/>\nhe thought that all of his words would be adequate representations of<br/>\nthe sounds he meant by his letter, but he was very wrong here. Try to<br/>\nunderstand the confusion this creates, especially for beginners. At the <br/>\nsame time, I don&#39;t think Read wanted one letter to serve for different <br/>\nsounds. I believe he wanted the opposite: one letter equals one and only <br/>\none sound. There was already a system where one letter could represent <br/>\nmore than one sound, traditional orthography (that is, normal writing), <br/>\nand Read rejected this system. The whole foundation of QS is based on <br/>\none sound per letter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not proscribing that one dialect is superior to the other, or that <br/>\none should have to write QS in a standard dialect. Quite the opposite. I <br/>\n  am trying to make QS more precise so that dialects can be expressed <br/>\naccurately.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, the sounds are not expressed clearly. I want the sounds <br/>\ndescribed in a precise way. That way, when I use #34 (for example), I <br/>\nknow exactly what sound I am writing, and a reader of my writing to <br/>\nunderstand exactly what I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe IPA would give us a very precise way to show how each letter should <br/>\nsound. For those who don&#39;t have any linguistics background, I have <br/>\nproposed that we give much fuller, linguist-*like_ descriptions of the <br/>\nletters, and Anthony Grahn has agreed to making such a chart.
