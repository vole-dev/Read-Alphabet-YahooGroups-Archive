Proper spelling is \nengrained in most people today, but I believe that in Elizabethan times \nthe concept of a &quot;correct&quot; spelling was either non-existent or much \nweaker.  I would argue that if it is clear what word you are intending \nto represent, a slightly different spelling from an arbitrary &quot;standard&quot; \nshould cause no difficulty in reading.\n\nI think it is fair to say that most languages are not spread around the \nglobe as widely as English is so alternate pronunciations in English may \nbe more likely to occur.  Another point is that English seems peculiarly \nresistant to modification of standardized spelling over time when \npronunciation has changed as compared to other languages such as German \nor Spanish.  Perhaps that is due to the independent nature of the \nEnglish Speaking Peoples.\n\nI have not gone back and checked the group messages from the past, but I \nremember long detailed discussions about how necessary standardizing QS \nspelling was.  The people pushing this idea seem much more focused on \nthis than seems necessary to me, and they seemed very adamant about it.  \nI see it as a slippery slope. Okay, now that we have straightened out \nEnglish spelling and made it sensible again, let&#39;s start back down the \nsame path that got us into this mess to begin with.\n\nRegards,\n\n\nPaige Gabhart\n\nP.S.  The state of English spelling brings about other unanticipated \nresults.  Recently, I have noticed people spelling the names of their \nchildren in ways that do not follow normal English spelling precepts.  \nThese parents appear to believe that letters may be freely put into \nwords and then ignored in the pronunciation of the resulting name.  I \nguess the letter is stuck in to provide &quot;uniqueness.&quot;  Example:  \n&quot;Elijiah,&quot; but pronounced according to the parent as &quot;Elijah;&quot; or \n&quot;Tanikia&quot; pronounced &quot;Tanika.&quot;  I suspect if you asked them what the \nextra, unpronounced &quot;i&quot; was for, they would look at you blankly.  This \nmay go back to the number of exceptions that actual English spelling \npresents when compared to the standard spelling rules.  I think many \npeople do not understand the concept that each letter should represent a \nsound present in the word.\n\nThe idea of the existence of &quot;silent&quot; letters brings this out.  A couple \nof years ago I learned of an elementary teacher who was telling her \nyoung students that the &quot;h&quot; in words such as &quot;which&quot; and &quot;why&quot; was a \nsilent letter.  Presumably, for her it was, but I suspect she had no \nidea that many people still pronounce it and consider it important.  No \nwonder it is a dying sound with that lack of knowledge on the part of \nthe people teaching our children.\n\n\nOn 2/21/2013 12:25 PM, John Cowan wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Paige Gabhart scripsit:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I agree as well.

Unstandardized QS does not affect&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; understandability. So if that is the case then it\n              should not be a&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; problem for people to write as they speak. I am a\n              U.S. citizen, and&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; in the mid 70s I corresponded with a man in New\n              Zealand in QS. I&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; had no difficulty in understanding his QS. I think\n              the drive toward&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; standardizing QS arises out of the same human desire\n              for uniformity&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; that sent TO down the wrong path centuries ago.&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n              Historically, the pressure to standardize orthographies\n              comes from publishers,&lt;br&gt;\n              who need to know the difference between a typo they should\n              correct and a mere&lt;br&gt;\n              variant spelling they must preserve. By not having variant\n              spellings, the&lt;br&gt;\n              distinction is more obvious. I know of no orthography\n              generally used for&lt;br&gt;\n              published works that is not standardized.&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n              -- &lt;br&gt;\n              John Cowan &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n                href=&quot;http://ccil.org/%7Ecowan&quot;&gt;http://ccil.org/~cowan&lt;/a&gt;\n              &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;mailto:cowan%40ccil.org&quot;&gt;cowan@...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &#39;Tis the Linux rebellion / Let coders take their place,&lt;br&gt;\n              The Linux-nationale / Shall Microsoft outpace,&lt;br&gt;\n              We can write better programs / Our CPUs won&#39;t stall,&lt;br&gt;\n              So raise the penguin banner of / The Linux-nationale.\n              --Greg Baker&lt;br&gt;\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n          \n      \n      &lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;pre class=&quot;moz-signature&quot; cols=&quot;72&quot;&gt;-- \n&#8220;Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery.&#8221; &#8212; Winston Churchill\n\n\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--------------070305050106040305000500--\r\n\n"
