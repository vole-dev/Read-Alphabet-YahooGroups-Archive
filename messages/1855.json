  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-432451237\">I am proposing a new way to assign ASCII letters that is a compromise<br/>\nbetween the SAMPA proposal and my proposal, and which will hopefully<br/>\nmake things clearer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think we should accept the SAMPA encoding as the default, since<br/>\nit forces users to forgo some natural pairs. Specifically, for years all<br/>\nof us<br/>\nhave have typed &quot;y&quot; for the sound in Yes [j], &quot;j&quot; for the sound in<br/>\n&quot;judge&quot; [dZ], and &quot;I&quot; for the proper pronoun [aI]. I can&#39;t accept giving<br/>\nup such an obvious keyboard mapping simply because SAMPA, a tool for<br/>\nlinguists, and seemingly based on European languages in general rather<br/>\nthan English specifically, says so. So I think we should adopt a<br/>\nstandard for ASCII based on what is easiest for English speakers to use<br/>\nand remember. SAMPA is no more a standard for QS than the meter is for<br/>\nmeasuring the volume of water.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has occurred while editing a dictionary for QS that I needed to<br/>\nencode my words in lexical sets rather than the representations for QS<br/>\nletters. For example, the dictionary I am using has _bore_ represented<br/>\nas [kU@r]. It took me a while to realize that the [U@r] belonged to the<br/>\nlexical set CURE. I had edited over 3,000 words when I became certain of<br/>\nthis, and many of those words I used the letters Wool + Ado + Roar.<br/>\nProbably the Ado does not belong, so I have to go back and change a lot<br/>\nof words.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would have been simpler for me to encode the word boor as such:<br/>\n<br/>\nboor b-CURE<br/>\n<br/>\nwhere the words on the left is the TO word, and the word on the right is<br/>\nthe transliteration. Now when it comes time to finalize the dictionary,<br/>\nI can simply replace all instances of -CURE with whatever QS letters we <br/>\ndecided were appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of such instances where I am making decisions on what <br/>\nletters to use, thereby losing information that I may want later, and <br/>\nwhich I cannot retrieve except by going back and re-editing 80,000 <br/>\nwords. For example, I have been removing the unstressed vowels before <br/>\n_r_ in words like _better_. It would be better if I had entered the word as:<br/>\n<br/>\nbetter b-DRESS-t-LETTER<br/>\n<br/>\nLater I can decide if I want to change LETTER to /ar/ or just to /r/. <br/>\nThe same is true of the _y_ endings at the end of words, such as Betty.<br/>\n<br/>\nbetty b-DRESS-t-HAPPY<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can decide later if we want HAPPY to become /i/ or /I/.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy proposal states that we assign a letter to each lexical set, rather <br/>\nthan each QS letter. In practice, we mostly do this, but we completely <br/>\nignore some important lexical sets and merge others. We should keep the <br/>\nsame letters that John originally suggested, the ones based on SAMPA. <br/>\nThus, /i/ still becomes Eat, part of the FLEECE lexical set. In an <br/>\nemail, the convention of using John&#39;s SAMPA mapping still would more or <br/>\nless hold, with the exception that we think of the letters as <br/>\nrepresenting lexical sets rather than actual letters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn practice, _dress_ becomes /drEs/, the same as it was. We can still <br/>\npaste that into a word processor, choose ThothSampa, and get a good QS <br/>\nrepresentation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the word _bird_ would become /bDd/, where D represents the NURSE <br/>\nlexical set. We should no longer think in terms of ligatures, which are <br/>\njust a typographical convention, but in terms of lexical sets, so that <br/>\nthe /D/ in this case should be as much as the standard as /E/.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis means that the font ThothSampa would have to be changed slightly. <br/>\nFirst, I would like to change the name to ThothLexical, a small change. <br/>\nMore importantly, I would need to make sure there is a sensible <br/>\nrepresentation for some of the lexical sets not yet represented, such as <br/>\nHappy /K/. That means just letting the key &quot;K&quot; represent Eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the full mapping proposal, with lexical sets, or pseudal lexical <br/>\n  sets, on the left and the letter to represent them on the right. The <br/>\ncomments come after the &quot;#&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul<br/>\n<br/>\nPS One other advantage of using lexical sets in this way is that it can <br/>\nhandle some of the mergers better. If I have all the BATH words <br/>\nseparated from the PATH words (admitedly not an easy task), I can choose <br/>\none vowel for a British transliteration and one for an American <br/>\ntransliteration.
