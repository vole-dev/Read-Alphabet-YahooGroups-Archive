In the same<br/>\nway, if we don&#39;t consider the entire character set of Senior<br/>\nQS from the outset we must map what we left out -- the half-<br/>\nletters -- to the rubble left over from the first round of<br/>\nmappings. We would e.g. totally miss that {J} is a<br/>\nreasonable mapping for #14, leaving us free to map {Z} to<br/>\nhalf-z (#12.5), totally analogous to the case with {G} for<br/>\n#21 and {N} for alternate #23 (#23.2).

In fact I<br/>\nthink that I in BPJ2 have found reasonable mappings for all<br/>\nthe letter forms sanctioned by QM save one: half-d (#4.5)<br/>\nand {R} were simply the odd men out, but even for them I<br/>\nwas able to find an albeit far-fetched memory cue, namely<br/>\nthat American /d/ (and /t/, which usually is merged with<br/>\n/d/ in this position: _good at, get it_) between vowels<br/>\nsounds like a kind of _r_ to speakers of some accents of<br/>\nEnglish and many foreign languages. In old British movies<br/>\neven RP speakers can be heard using a sound of this kind<br/>\nfor the /r/ in words like _very, worry, carry_. This is not<br/>\nto say that BPJ2 is the only possible alternative if one<br/>\nwants to find satisfactory mappings for the half- letters<br/>\n-- it clearly isn&#39;t --, but only to say that the mappings<br/>\nfor the half-letters would have been much more random, and<br/>\nhence unsatisfactory, if they had not been considered from<br/>\nthe outset.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would really like to hear what native speakers think of<br/>\nthe mapping of #14 to {J}. All cases of TO _j_ (or _g_)<br/>\ncorrsponding to #14, and all words where there is variation<br/>\nbetween the sounds of #14 and #16, are recent French loans,<br/>\nbut {Z} for half-z and {J} for #14 is much better than the<br/>\nother way around, since half-z is possibly the most used half-<br/>\nletter. The question is hopefully not *if* {J} for #14 is<br/>\nacceptable for native speakers/writers -- it ought to be at<br/>\nleast as acceptable as {I} for #27 and {E} for #29, which<br/>\nhave to be memory-cued with the foreignisms &quot;Igor&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;Etude&quot; respectively --, but rather *how* acceptable it is.<br/>\nTo my Swedish ear #14 and #16 are the French and English<br/>\nsound of _j_ respectively, both sounds being foreign to my<br/>\nnative language.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has of course been observed by spelling reformers that<br/>\nthe functional load of #14 is very low in English, so that<br/>\nit might be merged with either #13 or #16, and in that vein<br/>\nit might either form a pair with #13 and be mapped to {Z},<br/>\nor form a pair with #16 and be mapped to {J}. Read obviously<br/>\nsaw the sounds of #14 and #16 as related, since he gave them<br/>\nletters which were related in shape, but #12 is arguably<br/>\nalso a related letter-shape for a related sound -- indeed<br/>\n#11-16 are a triplet of pairs of related letter-shapes for<br/>\nrelated forms. I&#39;d say the resemblance between #14 and #16<br/>\nis greater than between #14 and #12, but then again #13 is<br/>\nalso closer to #15 than to #11, and I don&#39;t think anybody<br/>\nwould seriously consider mapping #13 to {C}!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe attractiveness of mapping half-z to {Z} is and remains<br/>\nthe strongest argument in favor of mapping #14 to {J}, but I<br/>\nthink it is strong enough. I realize that {J} is hardly the<br/>\nnative speaker/writer&#39;s first choice for #14, but at least<br/>\nRead&#39;s letter-name _J&#39;ai_ will still work!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; To start off discussion, I&#39;d like to see if we can move<br/>\n &gt; our proposals closer together over the next couple of<br/>\n &gt; weeks.
