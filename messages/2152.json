I&#39;m interested in learning Quickscript to teach English sounds to my students.  When I teach English sounds using the International Phonetic Alphabet, my students confuse pronunciation of the IPA letters with their own native language letters.  I&#39;ve been looking for something to represent a sound without using familiar letters from the alphabet.
