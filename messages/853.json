It has been r=\r\neprinted by UMI Books on Demand.  www.umi.com.  I found a copy on ABE for s=\r\nale late last yr.  Shaw admired this system, but objected to the obscure an=\r\nd sometimes extreme abbreves used by Sweet.  Quikscript is best if you pref=\r\ner a strictly phonetic writing system.  For lecture, meeting, or journal no=\r\ntes, nothing beats Current Shorthand, chiefly due to its flexibility.  The =\r\nwriting is abt half as brief as longhand, but flows far more quickly, since=\r\n there are very few pen stops compared to longhand.  This system could be t=\r\nypeset.  It is graceful and rather Elvish-looking, but still very neat and =\r\ncompact.\n\nHugh L. Callendar&#39;s Cursive Orthographic Shorthand can only be fo=\r\nund thru the Interlibrary Loan Dept. of the New York Public Library System.=\r\n  This is by far the easiest symbol system I&#39;ve encountered.  It uses mostl=\r\ny the same symbols as Gregg, but rearranged to emphasize lineality and legi=\r\nbility over speed, since it uses TO.  It is not nearly as fast as Gregg, bu=\r\nt more than adequate for school.  It is extremely easy to write, but like a=\r\nll skills, needs daily practice for mastery.  The writing is not terribly g=\r\nraceful, but at least does not sprawl over two lines.  It is much easier to=\r\n read and write than Gregg Notehand.\n\nI learned of these two systems via th=\r\ne MSN Gregg Shorthand Website, under the Anything Goes link.  Many other sy=\r\nstems are discussed under that link.  There are links to many other useful =\r\nand interesting websites devoted shorthand.  \n\nBoth are easy to learn, but,=\r\n of course, require lots of practice to automatize the writing.   Either on=\r\ne can be written w/o the vowels, if more speed is required.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHa=\r\nrry\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ramses Oudt \n  To: Read_Alphabe=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, September 14, 2006 12:56 PM\n  Subject:=\r\n [Read_Alphabet] Re: speed\n\n\n  You have some URL&#39;s for info about these sys=\r\ntems?

Both use longhand spellin=\r\ng, so are \n  easy to&lt;BR&gt;learn. The words all stay btwn the lines, and in th=\r\ne case of \n  Sweet&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;Current, is very nearly as lineal as longhand. Hand=\r\nywrite \n  is&lt;BR&gt;essentiallly based on Greg, and is even harder and more \n  =\r\ntime-consuming&lt;BR&gt;to learn. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Quikscript is also fast enuf =\r\nfor \n  notetaking, if you use the Senior&lt;BR&gt;form. It does take a lot of pra=\r\nctice to \n  learn to anticipate when the&lt;BR&gt;letters join and to use the alt=\r\nernate \n  forms.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Good luck.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Harry&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n ----- \n  Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: matthew smith &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: =\r\n&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:Read_Alphabet%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;Read_Alphabet@&lt;WBR&gt;ya=\r\nhoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 13, 2006 3:27=\r\n PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: \n  [Read_Alphabet] Re: speed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; thank you for your input i \n  think that i will learn both and see&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nwhich i like better&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Hermann Philipps &lt;hphilipps@.&lt;WB=\r\nR&gt;..&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Although \n  Quikscript is faster than ord=\r\ninary letters (once you&lt;BR&gt;are used&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to \n  it) it may not be suffici=\r\nently fast for really speedy&lt;BR&gt;writing.
