  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2065920093\">Some more comments, now that I have read the whole thing:<br/>\n<br/>\nI looked at the PDF at several sizes, and it holds up well down to about 9 point (an <br/>\napproximation).  But I find this true for most serif fonts on a screen: printed I think it <br/>\nwould look great at that size or even smaller.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have to agree about See and Zoo.  I think the top curl on Zoo should be shorter (as <br/>\nit normally starts at the baseline).  I like the way Ye and Bay, while similar (though rotated) <br/>\nare subtly different.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I agree that the hooks on Fee Vie and May are unfamiliar and perhaps unnecessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I noted before, an italicized Ooze would look just like Eat.  I found Foot and Ooze <br/>\ndifficult to recognize at first, so maybe they could be more rounded (and still sufficiently <br/>\ndifferent from the other vowel sounds).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &#39;er&#39; and &#39;ia&#39; diphthongs could be made a little wider, to match up with some of the <br/>\nother diphthong characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI notice that the &#39;x&#39; in &#39;except&#39; has a serif on the bottom side, though it is the unvoiced <br/>\nversion.  I suggest extending the leg (and serif) up for the unvoiced and down for the <br/>\nvoiced version.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ball on the end of Day sometimes confused me, thinking that it was a period.  I didn&#39;t <br/>\nnotice this with other characters.  If it came to a point or a flat-ended serif it would be less <br/>\nconfusing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I noticed what I think might be some misspellings (but I am not really sure):<br/>\nin paragraph 1: &#39;intelligently&#39; should have a Jay character instead of Gay<br/>\nin paragraph 2: &#39;she&#39;s&#39; should have a terminal Zoo<br/>\nin paragraph 2: &#39;easily&#39; should have a Zoo<br/>\nin paragraph 3: &#39;current&#39; should not have the Roe character after the &#39;er&#39; diphthong<br/>\nin paragraph 4: &#39;easy&#39; should have a Zoo<br/>\nin the last paragraph, should &#39;our&#39; be &#39;out&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor two words, &#39;noticed&#39; and &#39;replaced&#39; I would pronounce the terminal characters as Tea, <br/>\nbut I note in the QS manual that Read suggested using a single Day character for all <br/>\nterminal &#39;ed&#39; sounds.  I think this makes sense for -d vs. -ed sounds in &#39;loved&#39; and &#39;hated,&#39; <br/>\nbut for unvoiced terminal &#39;t&#39; sounds I think Tea presents more accurate representation.  <br/>\nAfter all, Read does use both See and Zoo as plural terminals.  Also, using Read&#39;s -ed rule <br/>\n&#39;added&#39; in the 4th paragraph would have no Utter character, just two Day characters one <br/>\nafter the other (a rare doubling of characters in QS).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this doesn&#39;t sound at all negative, but rather constructive.
