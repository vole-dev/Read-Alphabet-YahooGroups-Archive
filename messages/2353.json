  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-620489342\">Yes, I&#39;m from Ontario, and I can see that I may gravitate to #34 and not worry too much about the subtleties of #32 and #33.  There are some minor differences in how I pronounce those, but #34 does the trick in most cases.  I am preserving #32+#25 as I find it easier to write, and I just treat it as a single sound.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting that you comment on looking at QS and not having the meaning jump out at you.  That would be great, but for now I have to labour through most of the sounds.  There are some words I can recognize at a glance, but not enough to get instant meaning from a line of text.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for replying Scott...<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;guanolto&quot; &lt;scott@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;stratocat6969&quot; &lt;john-bergsma@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your reply.
