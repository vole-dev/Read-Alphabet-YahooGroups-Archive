This is fine if you<br/>\n&gt; happen to know the IPA, but it is my contention that if we<br/>\n&gt; want to reach the general population of English writers who<br/>\n&gt; were taught traditional orthography (T.O.) in school, the IPA<br/>\n&gt; is no help because the general public knows little or nothing<br/>\n&gt; about it.  It makes more sense to me to use a system that has<br/>\n&gt; some relation to T.O. which English readers and writers do<br/>\n&gt; know about.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know IPA quite well, as I have studied phonetics and am<br/>\ngenerally interrested in writing systems, but I nevertheless<br/>\nfind it irksome that /j/ (Ye) is mapped to the |j| key, and<br/>\nnot to the |y| key.  I also would prefer the heavy vowels<br/>\n(Eight, Eat, I, Owe, Ewe) mapped to the upper-case vowels<br/>\n|A E I O U|.
