  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2140301571\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to add to my keyboard idea that it is better to make a<br/>\ncomplete break with the Orthodox ways and just go for the most<br/>\nefficient layout. If the layout follows the &#39;qwerty&#39; way we inherit<br/>\nsome cruft that people might have to live with a looong time. Let&#39;s<br/>\nreuse Dvorak&#39;s keyboard ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis alphabet is meant to replace the old way completely so a<br/>\nkeyboard mapping should not get rid of useful symbols. Some missing<br/>\nsymbols in Oliver&#39;s mapping are necessary for programming and other<br/>\ntasks. Let&#39;s not get rid of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as to the unicode proposal, why not just *re-use* the Shavian<br/>\nmapping which is already there? There is no &#39;obligation&#39; to display<br/>\nexactly the glyphs as in the standard (per the standard). What needs<br/>\nto be added is a couple of symbols to reach Junior QS. That is all.<br/>\nBut I think that the proposal should not only aim for that but to<br/>\nattempt to include Senior QS. An effort needs to be made to find all<br/>\npossible ligatures, half letters, zig-zag cases and develop ways fit<br/>\nthose into the proposal. If it can be done for Arabic, Devnagari, and<br/>\nTraditional Chinese then there is hope. I think it is less politic to<br/>\npropose a completely new mapping than it would be to offer an<br/>\namplification, an enrichment of what is already there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the lexicographic order I mentioned ... uh well. The one that<br/>\nRead proposed has many neat properties. But they are about the<br/>\ncharacters themselves. And in that it is like other alphabets. Imagine<br/>\nan order that actually encodes information about the language it is<br/>\nused to write! And non-trivial information at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother possible order that might be nice is one win which the order<br/>\nis determined by the frequency of the character appearing after the<br/>\npreceeding character in the order. For example, the first letter would<br/>\nbe the one with which the majority of words start. The second, the one<br/>\nthat most commonly follows the first in words etc. Is this a good<br/>\nidea?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure that better ideas will surface. I think that order is not<br/>\npart of the Unicode standard (?) but can be added on later. In any<br/>\nevent, thought should go into this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, for ease of learning, once an order is chosen it might be nice<br/>\nto choose phoneme-appropiate, alternative (or additional) keyword<br/>\nnames for the characters that *formed a complete sentence(s)*. Even if<br/>\nonly for teaching purposes. A rhyme would be great. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, an even crazier idea. How about a locale en_jQS? Take a linux<br/>\n (or some other malleable OS) installation, translate all the message<br/>\ncatalogs into Junior QS (with simple software and a dictionay this can<br/>\nbe done rather easily I think -- except for the lack of a monospace<br/>\nfont for JQS). Voila! The entire system in QS (almost)!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is only my second post (as far as I know) to this group so sorry<br/>\nif these ideas are old and have been rehashed as nauseum in the past.<br/>\nPlease tell me if that is the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.</div>",
