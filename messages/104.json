I had intended to work<br/>\nsome more on it before posting<br/>\nit, but I have not found the time.  Since we are getting so many posts<br/>\non remapping the keyboard and<br/>\nways to go about that, I felt I should get my two cents in.  I am not<br/>\nsure if my suggestion as set out<br/>\nbelow of using &quot;d,&quot; &quot;f,&quot; &quot;j,&quot; and &quot;k&quot; as &quot;function&quot; keys causing the<br/>\nother keys to alter their output would<br/>\nbe feasible.

I<br/>\n   have no experience at this and was blissfully ignorant of the<br/>\ncontortions people using<br/>\n   computers with other languages were having to deal with, but you have<br/>\ngot me thinking<br/>\n   about it.  I also had not considered the needs of an individual who<br/>\ntypes in QS as<br/>\n   part of his job and who needs to develop as much speed as a typist in<br/>\nroman.  Of<br/>\n   course, we do not have anyone in that position now, but it makes<br/>\nsense if we go to the<br/>\n   trouble of remaping Jerome that we should make the new keyboard as<br/>\nefficient as<br/>\n   possible.  By the way, you are the only person I have actually<br/>\ncommunicated with that<br/>\n   has tried Dvorak.  My knowledge about it was totally academic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   After considering your post, I have attached in wordpad format a<br/>\nproposed remapping of<br/>\n   Jerome, which I believe is much more logical than what we have now<br/>\nand adopts some of<br/>\n   your suggestions.  The remainder of this post explains my thinking<br/>\nregarding this<br/>\n   remapping.<br/>\n<br/>\n   It had not occurred to me to use another key (rather than &quot;shift&quot;)<br/>\nfor the purpose of<br/>\n   producing all the letters needed for QS.  I guess I was still<br/>\nthinking along<br/>\n   typewriter lines.  (I did know that each key combination produces a<br/>\nbinary code which<br/>\n   is at some point translated by (I assume a driver) into the<br/>\nappropriate character for<br/>\n   the output.)  It makes sense that it would be slightly faster to<br/>\nutilize a letter on<br/>\n   the home row rather than the &quot;shift&quot; key to specify an alternate<br/>\ncharacter for a<br/>\n   particular key since it eliminates the need to move a finger off the<br/>\nhome row.<br/>\n<br/>\n   In effect what we require is similar to a function key on a<br/>\nscientific calculator,<br/>\n   which after it is activated, causes the regular keys to return a<br/>\ndifferent output<br/>\n   after activation than their default output.  I have a scientific<br/>\ncalculator which uses<br/>\n   two separate function keys which permits each regular key to serve<br/>\nthree different<br/>\n   functions.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Since there are fifteen (15) vowels in the QS alphabet and five (5)<br/>\nin the roman<br/>\n   alphabet, it seems to make sense for each roman vowel to be mapped to<br/>\nthree (3)<br/>\n   different vowels in QS.  Therefore, we need to map two function keys<br/>\nfor the left hand<br/>\n   and two function keys for the right hand just as we now have a right<br/>\nand left shift<br/>\n   key.  I propose that the left hand function keys be &quot;f&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, and<br/>\nthe right hand<br/>\n   function keys be &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k.&quot;  This uses the forefinger and index<br/>\nfinger of each hand<br/>\n   which for the average person are probably the two strongest and agile<br/>\nfingers on each<br/>\n   hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I have mapped a, e, i, o and u with three QS vowels each.  The<br/>\nprimary key by itself<br/>\n   returns the long vowel.  The primary key plus the opposite hand&#39;s<br/>\nforefinger, i.e. &quot;f&quot;<br/>\n   or &quot;j&quot; returns the short vowel, and the primary key plus the opposite<br/>\nhand&#39;s index<br/>\n   finger, i.e. &quot;d&quot; or &quot;k&quot; returns the final vowel, which is an<br/>\nadditional vowel<br/>\n   generally associated with the roman vowel with the exception of the<br/>\nthird vowel on the<br/>\n   &quot;i&quot; key.  (I guess no system is perfect.)  Since all QS vowels are<br/>\nmapped to the<br/>\n   standard five roman vowels, they should be fairly easy to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Again, for ease of learning, I placed the half-letters on the same<br/>\nkeys as their<br/>\n   primary letters, and they are activated by pressing the forefinger of<br/>\nthe opposite<br/>\n   hand at the same time.  &quot;Q&quot; remained unused, and it made sense to map<br/>\nit to wholewheat<br/>\n   and half-wholewheat as it was next to &quot;W&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n   &quot;X&quot; remained unused so I mapped the two QS equivalents to that key.<br/>\nNow you can keep<br/>\n   both of them, Jon.  I assume the &quot;ks&quot; should be the primary key, and<br/>\nthe &quot;gs&quot; would be<br/>\n   the secondary key obtained by simultaneous pressing of the opposite<br/>\nhand forefinger,<br/>\n   i.e. &quot;j.&quot;  I mapped alternate &quot;No&quot; to the &quot;n&quot; key, again with the<br/>\nsecondary function<br/>\n   obtained by hitting it with &quot;f&quot;.  I mapped &quot;Inkling&quot; as the primary<br/>\nkey for &quot;c&quot;, and<br/>\n   the secondary is the alternate form of &quot;Up&quot;.  The namer dot I mapped<br/>\nto the secondary<br/>\n   position for &quot;m&quot;.  This puts it next to the comma which seemed<br/>\nappropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n   This covers everything except the following:  sh, ch, zh, th, dh and<br/>\nthe alternate<br/>\n   form &quot;Other&quot;.  I followed your suggestion and mapped them as two<br/>\nletter combinations.<br/>\n   &quot;Other&quot; I mapped to &quot;xh&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Check out the attached file with its chart, and let me know your<br/>\nthoughts on this.  I<br/>\n   believe it will be much easier to learn than what we have had so far.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Paige</div>",
