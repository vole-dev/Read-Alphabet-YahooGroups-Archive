Does this imply that joined diphthong<br/>\nletters could still be displayed?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to suggest the use of an alternate glyph for the letter<br/>\n&quot;Ye,&quot; which would be the half-letter &quot;Ye&quot;, i.e. the top of the<br/>\nstandard letter.  In the long years since I started using QS, at some<br/>\npoint, I  extended Read&#39;s logic behind half-letters and devised that<br/>\nhalf-letter myself, albeit, inadvertently.  It works just as well as a<br/>\nhalf-&quot;T&quot; or half-&quot;P&quot; does and causes no confusion in reading.

If we are going to have<br/>\nhalf-letters available, which I feel add much interest to the alphabet<br/>\nas well as producing more distinctive and easily recognizable<br/>\nword-shapes, there really seems no reason not to include it as an<br/>\nalternate glyph along with the other half-letters.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaige<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;oliver langan&quot;<br/>\n&lt;oliverlangan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Welcome to the group.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The unicode mapping hasn&#39;t gotten off the ground yet.

Given that Shavian already has a Unicode mapping,<br/>\n&gt; it would probably be possible to re-use those encodings for glyphs<br/>\n&gt; which exist in both scripts.  We would only need to add glyphs for<br/>\n&gt; &quot;why&quot; &quot;loch&quot; &quot;llan&quot; &quot;excite&quot; and &quot;examine&quot;.  However, I have two<br/>\n&gt; reservations about this.  Firstly, there is the overloaded &quot;ado/up&quot;<br/>\n&gt; vowel, for which there are two characters in shavian but only one in<br/>\n&gt; quickscript.  Secondly, the shavian proposal included several<br/>\n&gt; diphthongs as separate glyph encodings, &quot;ian&quot; &quot;ear&quot; &quot;air&quot; etc.  These<br/>\n&gt; really should NOT be separate glyphs: they should be entered and<br/>\n&gt; stored as two separate glyphs, and only presented as ligatures when<br/>\n&gt; they are displayed.  Giving ligatures a separate encoding will play<br/>\n&gt; hell with sorting/searching, etc.  In the same way, characters for<br/>\n&gt; which there are multiple glyphs, such as the multiple ways of writing<br/>\n&gt; &quot;may&quot; and &quot;no&quot;, should have only a single encoding but multiple<br/>\n&gt; associated glyphs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What certainly has not gotten off the ground is a formal Unicode<br/>\n&gt; proposal.  According to:<br/>\n&gt; \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unicode.org/pending/proposals.html\">http://www.unicode.org/pending/proposals.html</a> *<br/>\n&gt; the proposal process can take quite a long time--years--especially for<br/>\n&gt; entire scripts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A good first step is to gather comments from interested partied (that<br/>\n&gt; would be all you people on this list), so that the proposed mapping<br/>\n&gt; can be modified if necessary.  Then, sending a semi-formal notice of<br/>\n&gt; intent to the Unicode mail list is probably a good next step to take.<br/>\n&gt;  And of course, starting work on a first draft of the formal proposal.<br/>\n&gt;  As I recall, the formal proposal is a bit confusing... but I am sure<br/>\n&gt; we can all muddle through it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; oliver<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * The Unicode site was down earlier today when I was looking at it;<br/>\n&gt; but the google cache was available.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
