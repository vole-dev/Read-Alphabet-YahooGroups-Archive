And no<br/>\n&gt;  Sampa X. I just read an email and couldn&#39;t follow it because it was in<br/>\n&gt;  Sampa X. Could we possibly agree to using this direct method before I do<br/>\n&gt;  more work on the font? I am very over-burdened as it is, so having to<br/>\n&gt;  try to keep Sampa X and the archaic letter names, as well as other<br/>\n&gt;  naming methods, is driving me crazy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; For typing in email, I had in mind following QS-SAMPA, so &quot;bird&quot; would<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; be /byrd/. If your font becomes the de-facto standard for ligatures,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; then of course /bPd/ would work as well, but that&#39;s an extension of<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; QS-SAMPA that is very un-SAMPA-like. If someone sends me QS in<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; plain-text, I wouldn&#39;t expect it to look as beautiful as a finished<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; document with specified font size, etc. So if letters that could be in<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; ligatures remain unconnected, that seems fine to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I think we may have to go with an un-SAMPA like solution for this one<br/>\n&gt;  case. To really use SAMPA, we should write /b3rd/. But there is no way<br/>\n&gt;  to get a font to handle /3r/. We need the number &quot;3&quot; as its own<br/>\n&gt;  character. If a font converts /3/ to some QS letter, we won&#39;t be able to<br/>\n&gt;  use &quot;3,&quot; an obviously unworkable solution.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I feel that /3r/ is the one phoneme that is handled poorly at this<br/>\n&gt;  point. Since some of our time will be spent discussing this inadequacy,<br/>\n&gt;  and some of it will be spent discussing how to spell words with /3r/, I<br/>\n&gt;  think we should adopt a non-standard SAMPA letter. We can choose P if we<br/>\n&gt;  like. That way, if someone cuts and pasts /bPd/, into a word processer<br/>\n&gt;  and chooses ThothSampa, he will get a letter that makes sense. Also, in<br/>\n&gt;  the future, if we decide that /3r/ gets its own letter (something I hope<br/>\n&gt;  for), it becomes simpler to convert anything already written with P.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Regarding the alternate letters &#39;Noon&#39; and &#39;Up&#39;, I don&#39;t think it will<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; be difficult to implement their use in software.
