  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1751191316\">Hello; I&#39;m fairly new to Quickscript. I just found out about it a few months ago and have been interested in practicing and learning more about it since then. I wanted to share two ideas I&#39;ve had about the system while practicing writing in it. Any feedback on these would be appreciated. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne idea is a system to write Quickscript on a single line for applications like signs and display text (the equivalent of block capitals in the Latin alphabet). While Read makes good use of tall and short letters, there are actually only a few sets of letters that would cause confusion if written on the same line (rather than the 3 usually used). For these sets, a short horizontal line representing the letter&#39;s point of intersection with what Read calls the upper parallel could be added, so letters 3 and 26 would look like a Latin &#39;T&#39; with the bar about 2/3 of the way up and a lowercase &#39;l&#39; respectively. The other sets needing this distinction are 8/13, 21/23 (depending on the orientation of 23), and potentially 19/36. Everything else could be distinguished on a single line, although some ligatures/connections could be disrupted. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea is a possible alternative ligature for &#39;x&#39;; while writing, I realized that the &#39;k&#39; and &#39;s&#39; (5 and 11) in the x in &#39;ax&#39; make an almost perfect ligature if written side-by-side, which is essentially an inverted version of letter 21. I noticed I was using this for the two sounds and preferred it to Read&#39;s &#39;x&#39; ligature, and thought other people might be interested in this. I couldn&#39;t think of any better alternative for the &#39;gz&#39; version of &#39;x,&#39; although a deep version of the above letter occurred to me, as it has the deep loop of the &#39;g&#39;  (6) and somewhat resembles &#39;z&#39; (12) without being too similar to 14 or 22.</div>",
