When it is important to indicate<br>&gt; &gt;the time, \nIndonesians use words like &quot;already&quot; or &quot;tomorrow&quot;. English has<br>&gt; \n&gt;about 20 tenses (active and passive), including the progressive or<br>&gt; \n&gt;continuous forms, which do not exist in many languages.

There are \nmany irregular<br>&gt; &gt;verbs (e.g. shake - shook - shaken).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \nI would agree that some of these tenses are needlessly complex.&nbsp; On the \n<br>&gt; other hand, the preceding makes me wonder:&nbsp; when an Indonesian \nuses <br>&gt; &quot;tomorrow,&quot; meaning &quot;in the future&quot;, does he still signify the \nnext day, or <br>&gt; does it mean some unspecified future time?&nbsp; And if \nthe latter is the case, <br>&gt; then when he really means &quot;tomorrow,&quot; i.e. the \nnext day, he would have to <br>&gt; further specify that in some manner.&nbsp; A \nspeaker of a language using tenses <br>&gt; might find that needlessly \ncomplex.&nbsp; Obviously, language is interwoven into <br>&gt; a culture so \ndeeply that it is difficult to look with fresh eyes at a <br>&gt; language that \nis radically different from your own.&nbsp; Do other cultures <br>&gt; really \nexperience time differently from the way we do?&nbsp; Does the lack of <br>&gt; \ntenses in a language mean that the speaker does not view time as something \n<br>&gt; that passes -- that yesterday is forever gone and that tomorrow has not \nyet <br>&gt; arrived?&nbsp; This manner of seeing the universe seems so strange \nto an English <br>&gt; speaker that it is difficult to believe in it.<br>&gt; \n<br>&gt; If we think of language as a code for communicating ideas, there are \n<br>&gt; obviously methods that can compact the code.&nbsp; Inflections enable \nmore <br>&gt; information to be packed into fewer words.&nbsp; Word order \nbecomes less <br>&gt; important, as in Latin.&nbsp; With fewer inflections, word \norder becomes more <br>&gt; important, as in English.&nbsp; I believe Chinese \nuses no inflections so word <br>&gt; order is crucial.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Any \nnative speaker of a language has no trouble using it fluently, which is <br>&gt; \nnot to say eloquently.&nbsp; Simplification of grammar probably aids a <br>&gt; \nnon-native speaker in attaining fluency, but it also condemns the native \n<br>&gt; speaker to a less efficient form of communication all his life if the \n<br>&gt; simplified grammar becomes the norm.&nbsp; Of course, throughout \nhistory, the <br>&gt; non-native speaker was always vastly outnumbered by the \nnative speakers so <br>&gt; they newcomers had little impact on the evolution of \na language.&nbsp; Might <br>&gt; that be changing now with the increasing use of \nEnglish in the world?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; English tenses may seem needlessly \ncomplicated to a speaker of a language <br>&gt; who gets by with fewer or no \ntenses, but the meaning, as you noted, <br>&gt; sometimes has to clarified with \nthe additional words specifying when <br>&gt; something occurred.&nbsp; I would \nsuppose tenses seem so useful to us as a means <br>&gt; of reducing additional \nexplanations of when events occurred that they are <br>&gt; worth effort of \nlearning to us.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; You did not mention it, but I can only assume \nyou are not using Shawscript <br>&gt; with your students.&nbsp; Can you \ndifferentiate how much of the difficulty they <br>&gt; experience in learning \nEnglish is related to the grammar and how much to <br>&gt; the roman \nalphabet?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The difficulty of learning a language is, I assume, \nclosely related to what <br>&gt; language you already speak.&nbsp; I assume it \nwould be easier for me to <br>&gt; learn&nbsp; German than it would be to learn \nChinese since English is a germanic <br>&gt; language.&nbsp; If we could compare \nall the languages of the world and rate them <br>&gt; on a scale indicating the \ndifficulty in learning them, where would English <br>&gt; appear?&nbsp; I \nbelieve that English would not be one of the most difficult <br>&gt; languages \nto learn.&nbsp; Perhaps, it would be in the middle of the pack.&nbsp; I <br>&gt; \nwould be willing to bet that if the student was taught English with <br>&gt; \nShawscript or Quikscript, they would make considerably faster progress than \n<br>&gt; they do with roman script.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt;One question about the \nRead Alphabet: isn&#39;t it being overtaken by<br>&gt; &gt;technology? Writing is \nincreasingly being done on a keyboard, so there is<br>&gt; &gt;less need for a \ncursive script. In fact, cursive type is less clear -<br>&gt; &gt;especially on \na computer screen - than normal type. I find Shavian fonts<br>&gt; &gt;easier to \nread than the Read Alphabet.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I am flummoxed about the name for \nthis alphabet.&nbsp; Reed called it <br>&gt; Quikscript, and I have always used \nthat term.&nbsp; Some people did not care for <br>&gt; that.&nbsp; Some liked \nRevised Shaw.&nbsp; When I began this site,&nbsp; I chose Read <br>&gt; \nAlphabet, thinking it would honor its creator.&nbsp; And some people did not \n<br>&gt; like that name.&nbsp; At this point, I am still using \nQuikscript.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; To my mind, the beauty of Quikscript really appears \nin the Senior version <br>&gt; (as Read termed it).&nbsp; Junior Quikscript \nkeeps all the letters <br>&gt; separate.&nbsp; Senior Quikscript permits all \nletter joining that occurs <br>&gt; naturally, i.e. without additional \nconnecting lines.&nbsp; This means the <br>&gt; letters always retain their \nnormal shapes.&nbsp; One letter will connect to the <br>&gt; next&nbsp; when the \nfirst letters ends at the point where the next letter begins.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n&quot;Cursive&quot; may not be the best word to describe QS&#39;s appearance since in <br>&gt; \nroman writing that term implies the use of connecting lines which change \n<br>&gt; the appearance of the letters.&nbsp; (I have seen recent high school \ngraduates <br>&gt; use a connecting hump in front of an &quot;m&quot; (intended in cursive \nto connect <br>&gt; the letter to a preceding letter) even when the &quot;m&quot; is at \nthe beginning of <br>&gt; a word.&nbsp; Thus, you get a peculiar three-humped \nletter that looks bizarre to <br>&gt; me.&nbsp; And they will write &quot;n&quot; with two \nhumps no matter where it appears.)&nbsp; I <br>&gt; used the term cursive \nbecause many letters are connected to each other as <br>&gt; opposed to Shavian \nwhere they are all separate as in printing.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Regarding \ntechnology:&nbsp; while it is true that many people write with <br>&gt; \nkeyboards, that does not prevent a font such as Jerome from being <br>&gt; \nattractive and perfectly usable with a keyboard.&nbsp; It reproduces a good deal \n<br>&gt; of the spirit of handwritten QS and is perfectly legible.&nbsp; QS&#39;s \nletters <br>&gt; were designed to connect easily.&nbsp; The roman alphabet was \nnot.&nbsp; And I <br>&gt; believe pens and pencils are in no danger of \ndisappearing.&nbsp; Most of us <br>&gt; still use them on a daily basis.&nbsp; \nPerhaps, we should worry when <br>&gt; voice-recognition software really gets \ngood. :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I can read Shavian, but I&#39;m much faster at QS since \nI&#39;ve been using it for <br>&gt; 25 years and gave up Shavian in 1974 or \nso.&nbsp; QS is perfectly legible.&nbsp; I <br>&gt; would expect that you just \nhaven&#39;t had the practice with QS that you&#39;ve had <br>&gt; with Shavian.<br>&gt; \n<br>&gt; Paige<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; -------------------------- eGroups \nSponsor -------------------------~-~&gt;<br>&gt; Big News - eGroups is becoming \nYahoo!

I teach\n&gt; &gt;it here in Indonesia and my students have real problems with i=\r\nt. (It may be\n&gt; &gt;their teacher&#39;s fault.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Simon:  I may have stepped in=\r\n it.  Here you are actually in the trenches \n&gt; teaching it, and I&#39;m just sp=\r\neculating about my thoughts about learning \n&gt; it.  Obviously, since it is m=\r\ny native tongue, and I have never tried \n&gt; teaching it , I cannot properly =\r\nevaluate the difficulty it poses to foreign \n&gt; students.  I have always tho=\r\nught (and read in print) that English is a \n&gt; subtle and flexible language.=\r\n  Of course, that does not necessarily make it \n&gt; suitable for a &quot;world lan=\r\nguage.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; According to studies I have read about, Esperanto is much easi=\r\ner to learn \n&gt; than any native tongue.  The estimates I have seen are that =\r\nit is four to \n&gt; six times easier to learn than another European language. =\r\n Grammatically, \n&gt; it is certainly much easier.  But, that does not turn Es=\r\nperanto into a \n&gt; world language.  Unfortunately, masses of people do not t=\r\nake action based \n&gt; on logic or efficiency, but, rather, on what they see a=\r\ns in their own \n&gt; self-interest.  Esperantists claim several million Espera=\r\nnto-speakers in \n&gt; the world, but what is that compared to a population of =\r\nroughly six \n&gt; billion!  Obviously, a drop in the ocean.\n&gt; \n&gt; Returning to =\r\nEnglish:  I did not intend to claim it had discarded all \n&gt; unnecessary gra=\r\nmmar, just that it was considerably simpler than other \n&gt; European language=\r\ns.  I have no experience with Asian languages so I cannot \n&gt; compare them t=\r\no English.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not sure if this is correct, but from some things I ha=\r\nve read, it \n&gt; seems that languages reached a high level of grammatical com=\r\nplexity \n&gt; thousands of years ago, and that since then some languages have =\r\nbeen \n&gt; discarding that needless complexity.  This seems counterintuitive t=\r\no me.  I \n&gt; would have expected that language would become more complex ove=\r\nr time \n&gt; instead of simpler.  I have read that the discarding of inflectio=\r\nns in \n&gt; English may have been prompted by the necessities of communication=\r\n between \n&gt; the Angles and Saxons (I believe) and Vikings who eventually se=\r\nttled in the \n&gt; north of Britain after centuries of raiding.  They all spok=\r\ne germanic \n&gt; tongues with many similar root words, but the inflexions got =\r\nin the way of \n&gt; comprehension.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;It is true that other European langua=\r\nges have far more inflexions. English\n&gt; &gt;has no cases or gender. However, i=\r\nf you compare it with certain non-European\n&gt; &gt;languages, it is still unnece=\r\nssarily complex.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Indonesian, for instance, has no tenses. When it is=\r\n important to indicate\n&gt; &gt;the time, Indonesians use words like &quot;already&quot; or=\r\n &quot;tomorrow&quot;. English has\n&gt; &gt;about 20 tenses (active and passive), including=\r\n the progressive or\n&gt; &gt;continuous forms, which do not exist in many languag=\r\nes. There are several\n&gt; &gt;subtly different ways of talking about the future.=\r\n There are many irregular\n&gt; &gt;verbs (e.g. shake - shook - shaken).\n&gt; \n&gt; I wo=\r\nuld agree that some of these tenses are needlessly complex.  On the \n&gt; othe=\r\nr hand, the preceding makes me wonder:  when an Indonesian uses \n&gt; &quot;tomorro=\r\nw,&quot; meaning &quot;in the future&quot;, does he still signify the next day, or \n&gt; does=\r\n it mean some unspecified future time?  And if the latter is the case, \n&gt; t=\r\nhen when he really means &quot;tomorrow,&quot; i.e. the next day, he would have to \n&gt;=\r\n further specify that in some manner.  A speaker of a language using tenses=\r\n \n&gt; might find that needlessly complex.  Obviously, language is interwoven =\r\ninto \n&gt; a culture so deeply that it is difficult to look with fresh eyes at=\r\n a \n&gt; language that is radically different from your own.  Do other culture=\r\ns \n&gt; really experience time differently from the way we do?  Does the lack =\r\nof \n&gt; tenses in a language mean that the speaker does not view time as some=\r\nthing \n&gt; that passes -- that yesterday is forever gone and that tomorrow ha=\r\ns not yet \n&gt; arrived?  This manner of seeing the universe seems so strange =\r\nto an English \n&gt; speaker that it is difficult to believe in it.\n&gt; \n&gt; If we =\r\nthink of language as a code for communicating ideas, there are \n&gt; obviously=\r\n methods that can compact the code.  Inflections enable more \n&gt; information=\r\n to be packed into fewer words.  Word order becomes less \n&gt; important, as i=\r\nn Latin.  With fewer inflections, word order becomes more \n&gt; important, as =\r\nin English.  I believe Chinese uses no inflections so word \n&gt; order is cruc=\r\nial.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any native speaker of a language has no trouble using it fluently=\r\n, which is \n&gt; not to say eloquently.  Simplification of grammar probably ai=\r\nds a \n&gt; non-native speaker in attaining fluency, but it also condemns the n=\r\native \n&gt; speaker to a less efficient form of communication all his life if =\r\nthe \n&gt; simplified grammar becomes the norm.  Of course, throughout history,=\r\n the \n&gt; non-native speaker was always vastly outnumbered by the native spea=\r\nkers so \n&gt; they newcomers had little impact on the evolution of a language.=\r\n  Might \n&gt; that be changing now with the increasing use of English in the w=\r\norld?\n&gt; \n&gt; English tenses may seem needlessly complicated to a speaker of a=\r\n language \n&gt; who gets by with fewer or no tenses, but the meaning, as you n=\r\noted, \n&gt; sometimes has to clarified with the additional words specifying wh=\r\nen \n&gt; something occurred.  I would suppose tenses seem so useful to us as a=\r\n means \n&gt; of reducing additional explanations of when events occurred that =\r\nthey are \n&gt; worth effort of learning to us.\n&gt; \n&gt; You did not mention it, bu=\r\nt I can only assume you are not using Shawscript \n&gt; with your students.  Ca=\r\nn you differentiate how much of the difficulty they \n&gt; experience in learni=\r\nng English is related to the grammar and how much to \n&gt; the roman alphabet?=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The difficulty of learning a language is, I assume, closely related t=\r\no what \n&gt; language you already speak.  I assume it would be easier for me t=\r\no \n&gt; learn  German than it would be to learn Chinese since English is a ger=\r\nmanic \n&gt; language.  If we could compare all the languages of the world and =\r\nrate them \n&gt; on a scale indicating the difficulty in learning them, where w=\r\nould English \n&gt; appear?  I believe that English would not be one of the mos=\r\nt difficult \n&gt; languages to learn.  Perhaps, it would be in the middle of t=\r\nhe pack.  I \n&gt; would be willing to bet that if the student was taught Engli=\r\nsh with \n&gt; Shawscript or Quikscript, they would make considerably faster pr=\r\nogress than \n&gt; they do with roman script.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;One question about the Read=\r\n Alphabet: isn&#39;t it being overtaken by\n&gt; &gt;technology? Writing is increasing=\r\nly being done on a keyboard, so there is\n&gt; &gt;less need for a cursive script.=\r\n In fact, cursive type is less clear -\n&gt; &gt;especially on a computer screen -=\r\n than normal type. I find Shavian fonts\n&gt; &gt;easier to read than the Read Alp=\r\nhabet.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am flummoxed about the name for this alphabet.  Reed called i=\r\nt \n&gt; Quikscript, and I have always used that term.  Some people did not car=\r\ne for \n&gt; that.  Some liked Revised Shaw.  When I began this site,  I chose =\r\nRead \n&gt; Alphabet, thinking it would honor its creator.  And some people did=\r\n not \n&gt; like that name.  At this point, I am still using Quikscript.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\no my mind, the beauty of Quikscript really appears in the Senior version \n&gt;=\r\n (as Read termed it).  Junior Quikscript keeps all the letters \n&gt; separate.=\r\n  Senior Quikscript permits all letter joining that occurs \n&gt; naturally, i.=\r\ne. without additional connecting lines.  This means the \n&gt; letters always r=\r\netain their normal shapes.  One letter will connect to the \n&gt; next  when th=\r\ne first letters ends at the point where the next letter begins.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Cursi=\r\nve&quot; may not be the best word to describe QS&#39;s appearance since in \n&gt; roman =\r\nwriting that term implies the use of connecting lines which change \n&gt; the a=\r\nppearance of the letters.  (I have seen recent high school graduates \n&gt; use=\r\n a connecting hump in front of an &quot;m&quot; (intended in cursive to connect \n&gt; th=\r\ne letter to a preceding letter) even when the &quot;m&quot; is at the beginning of \n&gt;=\r\n a word.  Thus, you get a peculiar three-humped letter that looks bizarre t=\r\no \n&gt; me.  And they will write &quot;n&quot; with two humps no matter where it appears=\r\n.)  I \n&gt; used the term cursive because many letters are connected to each o=\r\nther as \n&gt; opposed to Shavian where they are all separate as in printing.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Regarding technology:  while it is true that many people write with \n&gt; =\r\nkeyboards, that does not prevent a font such as Jerome from being \n&gt; attrac=\r\ntive and perfectly usable with a keyboard.  It reproduces a good deal \n&gt; of=\r\n the spirit of handwritten QS and is perfectly legible.  QS&#39;s letters \n&gt; we=\r\nre designed to connect easily.  The roman alphabet was not.  And I \n&gt; belie=\r\nve pens and pencils are in no danger of disappearing.  Most of us \n&gt; still =\r\nuse them on a daily basis.  Perhaps, we should worry when \n&gt; voice-recognit=\r\nion software really gets good. :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; I can read Shavian, but I&#39;m much fa=\r\nster at QS since I&#39;ve been using it for \n&gt; 25 years and gave up Shavian in =\r\n1974 or so.  QS is perfectly legible.  I \n&gt; would expect that you just have=\r\nn&#39;t had the practice with QS that you&#39;ve had \n&gt; with Shavian.\n&gt; \n&gt; Paige\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; Read_Alphabet-=\r\nunsubscribe@egroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0004_01C071FE.EDBD1E40\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 5.50.4134.600&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3Djerome&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;/esperyntO z rWlI kul.&nbs=\r\np; F studId i wen F waz \nin mF tInz, n lDrnd mP v i in a manT Han F did V /=\r\nJDman in tM \njCz.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;---&lt;BR&gt;Shalom v&#39;Tovah,&lt;BR&gt;Jon =\r\nZuck&lt;BR&gt;Web URL: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://surf.to/frimmin&quot;&gt;http://surf.to/frimmin=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;It is more important to love much than to=\r\n think much.&lt;BR&gt;Always do that \nwhich most impels you to \nlove.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n--St. Ter=\r\nesa of Avila&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;----- Original Message ----- \n&lt;DIV&gt;From: &quot;C.

(It may \nbe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;their teacher=\r\n&#39;s fault.)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Simon:&nbsp; I may have \nstepped in it.&nbsp; H=\r\nere you are actually in the trenches &lt;BR&gt;&gt; teaching it, \nand I&#39;m just sp=\r\neculating about my thoughts about learning &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it.&nbsp; \nObviously, s=\r\nince it is my native tongue, and I have never tried &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nteaching it ,=\r\n I cannot properly evaluate the difficulty it poses to foreign \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; st=\r\nudents.&nbsp; I have always thought (and read in print) that English \nis a =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; subtle and flexible language.&nbsp; Of course, that does not \nnece=\r\nssarily make it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; suitable for a &quot;world language.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n\nAccording to studies I have read about, Esperanto is much easier to learn =\r\n\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; than any native tongue.&nbsp; The estimates I have seen are that =\r\nit is \nfour to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; six times easier to learn than another European lan=\r\nguage.&nbsp; \nGrammatically, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it is certainly much easier.&nbsp; Bu=\r\nt, that does not \nturn Esperanto into a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; world language.&nbsp; Unfo=\r\nrtunately, masses of \npeople do not take action based &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on logic or =\r\nefficiency, but, rather, on \nwhat they see as in their own &lt;BR&gt;&gt; self-in=\r\nterest.&nbsp; Esperantists claim \nseveral million Esperanto-speakers in &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; the world, but what is that \ncompared to a population of roughly six =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; billion!&nbsp; Obviously, a \ndrop in the ocean.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; R=\r\neturning to English:&nbsp; I did not intend \nto claim it had discarded all =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; unnecessary grammar, just that it was \nconsiderably simpler than o=\r\nther &lt;BR&gt;&gt; European languages.&nbsp; I have no \nexperience with Asian la=\r\nnguages so I cannot &lt;BR&gt;&gt; compare them to \nEnglish.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I a=\r\nm not sure if this is correct, but from some things \nI have read, it &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; seems that languages reached a high level of \ngrammatical complexity &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; thousands of years ago, and that since then some \nlanguages have been=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; discarding that needless complexity.&nbsp; This \nseems counterint=\r\nuitive to me.&nbsp; I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; would have expected that language \nwould bec=\r\nome more complex over time &lt;BR&gt;&gt; instead of simpler.&nbsp; I have \nread =\r\nthat the discarding of inflections in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; English may have been \npromp=\r\nted by the necessities of communication between &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the Angles and \nSa=\r\nxons (I believe) and Vikings who eventually settled in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; north o=\r\nf \nBritain after centuries of raiding.&nbsp; They all spoke germanic &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; \ntongues with many similar root words, but the inflexions got in the way=\r\n of \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; comprehension.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;It is true that other Eur=\r\nopean \nlanguages have far more inflexions. English&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;has no cases=\r\n or gender. \nHowever, if you compare it with certain non-European&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;languages, it \nis still unnecessarily complex.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\nIndonesian, for \ninstance, has no tenses. When it is important to indicate&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;the time, \nIndonesians use words like &quot;already&quot; or &quot;tomorrow&quot;. =\r\nEnglish has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;about 20 tenses (active and passive), including th=\r\ne progressive or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;continuous forms, which do not exist in many =\r\nlanguages. There are \nseveral&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;subtly different ways of talking =\r\nabout the future. There are \nmany irregular&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;verbs (e.g. shake -=\r\n shook - shaken).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nI would agree that some of these tenses=\r\n are needlessly complex.&nbsp; On the \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; other hand, the preceding m=\r\nakes me wonder:&nbsp; when an Indonesian \nuses &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;tomorrow,&quot; meaning=\r\n &quot;in the future&quot;, does he still signify the \nnext day, or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; does it =\r\nmean some unspecified future time?&nbsp; And if \nthe latter is the case, &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; then when he really means &quot;tomorrow,&quot; i.e. the \nnext day, he would h=\r\nave to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; further specify that in some manner.&nbsp; A \nspeaker of a =\r\nlanguage using tenses &lt;BR&gt;&gt; might find that needlessly \ncomplex.&nbsp; O=\r\nbviously, language is interwoven into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a culture so \ndeeply that it=\r\n is difficult to look with fresh eyes at a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; language that \nis radic=\r\nally different from your own.&nbsp; Do other cultures &lt;BR&gt;&gt; really \nexpe=\r\nrience time differently from the way we do?&nbsp; Does the lack of &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n \ntenses in a language mean that the speaker does not view time as somethin=\r\ng \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that passes -- that yesterday is forever gone and that tomorrow=\r\n has not \nyet &lt;BR&gt;&gt; arrived?&nbsp; This manner of seeing the universe se=\r\nems so strange \nto an English &lt;BR&gt;&gt; speaker that it is difficult to beli=\r\neve in it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If we think of language as a code for communic=\r\nating ideas, there are \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; obviously methods that can compact the cod=\r\ne.&nbsp; Inflections enable \nmore &lt;BR&gt;&gt; information to be packed into fe=\r\nwer words.&nbsp; Word order \nbecomes less &lt;BR&gt;&gt; important, as in Latin.&=\r\nnbsp; With fewer inflections, word \norder becomes more &lt;BR&gt;&gt; important, =\r\nas in English.&nbsp; I believe Chinese \nuses no inflections so word &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; order is crucial.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Any \nnative speaker of a language has =\r\nno trouble using it fluently, which is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nnot to say eloquently.&nbs=\r\np; Simplification of grammar probably aids a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nnon-native speaker i=\r\nn attaining fluency, but it also condemns the native \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; speaker to a=\r\n less efficient form of communication all his life if the \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; simplif=\r\nied grammar becomes the norm.&nbsp; Of course, throughout \nhistory, the &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; non-native speaker was always vastly outnumbered by the \nnative speak=\r\ners so &lt;BR&gt;&gt; they newcomers had little impact on the evolution of \na lan=\r\nguage.&nbsp; Might &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that be changing now with the increasing use of=\r\n \nEnglish in the world?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; English tenses may seem needlessly=\r\n \ncomplicated to a speaker of a language &lt;BR&gt;&gt; who gets by with fewer or=\r\n no \ntenses, but the meaning, as you noted, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sometimes has to clari=\r\nfied with \nthe additional words specifying when &lt;BR&gt;&gt; something occurred=\r\n.&nbsp; I would \nsuppose tenses seem so useful to us as a means &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of=\r\n reducing additional \nexplanations of when events occurred that they are &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; worth effort of \nlearning to us.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; You did not mentio=\r\nn it, but I can only assume \nyou are not using Shawscript &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with you=\r\nr students.&nbsp; Can you \ndifferentiate how much of the difficulty they &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; experience in learning \nEnglish is related to the grammar and how mu=\r\nch to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the roman \nalphabet?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The difficulty of lear=\r\nning a language is, I assume, \nclosely related to what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; language yo=\r\nu already speak.&nbsp; I assume it \nwould be easier for me to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; lear=\r\nn&nbsp; German than it would be to learn \nChinese since English is a german=\r\nic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; language.&nbsp; If we could compare \nall the languages of the w=\r\norld and rate them &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on a scale indicating the \ndifficulty in learni=\r\nng them, where would English &lt;BR&gt;&gt; appear?&nbsp; I \nbelieve that English=\r\n would not be one of the most difficult &lt;BR&gt;&gt; languages \nto learn.&nbsp;=\r\n Perhaps, it would be in the middle of the pack.&nbsp; I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nwould be=\r\n willing to bet that if the student was taught English with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nShaws=\r\ncript or Quikscript, they would make considerably faster progress than \n&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; they do with roman script.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;One question about th=\r\ne \nRead Alphabet: isn&#39;t it being overtaken by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;technology? Writi=\r\nng is \nincreasingly being done on a keyboard, so there is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;less =\r\nneed for a \ncursive script. In fact, cursive type is less clear -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;especially on \na computer screen - than normal type. I find Shavian font=\r\ns&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;easier to \nread than the Read Alphabet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am=\r\n flummoxed about the name for \nthis alphabet.&nbsp; Reed called it &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Quikscript, and I have always used \nthat term.&nbsp; Some people did not c=\r\nare for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that.&nbsp; Some liked \nRevised Shaw.&nbsp; When I began t=\r\nhis site,&nbsp; I chose Read &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nAlphabet, thinking it would honor it=\r\ns creator.&nbsp; And some people did not \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; like that name.&nbsp; At=\r\n this point, I am still using \nQuikscript.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To my mind, the=\r\n beauty of Quikscript really appears \nin the Senior version &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (as Re=\r\nad termed it).&nbsp; Junior Quikscript \nkeeps all the letters &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sepa=\r\nrate.&nbsp; Senior Quikscript permits all \nletter joining that occurs &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; naturally, i.e. without additional \nconnecting lines.&nbsp; This means =\r\nthe &lt;BR&gt;&gt; letters always retain their \nnormal shapes.&nbsp; One letter w=\r\nill connect to the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; next&nbsp; when the \nfirst letters ends at the =\r\npoint where the next letter begins.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&quot;Cursive&quot; may not be =\r\nthe best word to describe QS&#39;s appearance since in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nroman writing =\r\nthat term implies the use of connecting lines which change \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the ap=\r\npearance of the letters.&nbsp; (I have seen recent high school \ngraduates &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; use a connecting hump in front of an &quot;m&quot; (intended in cursive \nto c=\r\nonnect &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the letter to a preceding letter) even when the &quot;m&quot; is at \n=\r\nthe beginning of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a word.&nbsp; Thus, you get a peculiar three-hump=\r\ned \nletter that looks bizarre to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; me.&nbsp; And they will write &quot;n&quot;=\r\n with two \nhumps no matter where it appears.)&nbsp; I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; used the ter=\r\nm cursive \nbecause many letters are connected to each other as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; opp=\r\nosed to Shavian \nwhere they are all separate as in printing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Regarding \ntechnology:&nbsp; while it is true that many people write wit=\r\nh &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nkeyboards, that does not prevent a font such as Jerome from bei=\r\nng &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nattractive and perfectly usable with a keyboard.&nbsp; It repr=\r\noduces a good deal \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of the spirit of handwritten QS and is perfect=\r\nly legible.&nbsp; QS&#39;s \nletters &lt;BR&gt;&gt; were designed to connect easily.&n=\r\nbsp; The roman alphabet was \nnot.&nbsp; And I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; believe pens and pen=\r\ncils are in no danger of \ndisappearing.&nbsp; Most of us &lt;BR&gt;&gt; still use=\r\n them on a daily basis.&nbsp; \nPerhaps, we should worry when &lt;BR&gt;&gt; voice=\r\n-recognition software really gets \ngood. :-)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I can read Sh=\r\navian, but I&#39;m much faster at QS since \nI&#39;ve been using it for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 25 =\r\nyears and gave up Shavian in 1974 or \nso.&nbsp; QS is perfectly legible.&nb=\r\nsp; I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; would expect that you just \nhaven&#39;t had the practice with QS=\r\n that you&#39;ve had &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with Shavian.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Paige&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; -------------------------- eGroups \nSponsor ----------------=\r\n---------~-~&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Big News - eGroups is becoming \nYahoo!
