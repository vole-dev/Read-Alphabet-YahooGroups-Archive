  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-858912708\">The second book ever to be published in the Shaw Phonetic Alphabet... Poe Meets Shaw: The Shaw Alphabet Edition of Edgar Allan Poe. Not only will it contain a lot of his horror classics, but also love poetry, science fiction, science fact, book reviews, philosophical treatises, and even a documentary on how he wrote The Raven. There will be 2 versions of the book. The original will be 397 A4 pages long and have a side by side comparison between the Shaw Alphabet and traditional spelling like Androcles and the Lion and will run for $36.99 Canadian. The second version will be condensed down to 125 comic sized pages by dropping the font size while maintaining readability and completely dropping the traditional spelling safety net and will run for $14.99 Canadian. Please watch this space or the shawalphabet group for further details as they emerge.</div>",
