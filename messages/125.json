[snip]</tt></blockquote>I had reached that conclusion by the \n  time I sent the post that it wouldn&#39;t work for the reason you discussed.&nbsp; \n  But your solution of using a key (&quot;j&quot;) as a &quot;flag&quot; to alter the output of the \n  regular key will work just as well as what I had proposed.&nbsp; I toyed \n  around with the idea of using &quot;f&quot; as a flag for letters typed with the right \n  hand, but &quot;f&quot; can combine with too many other letters to form regular words so \n  I believe your choice of &quot;j&quot; as the single flag for the half-letters and \n  alternate &quot;n&quot; and &quot;x&quot; makes more sense.&nbsp; The two letter combinations for \n  namer dot should work fine in my opinion. \n  <p>I agree that the use of the half-letters should be left to the discretion \n  of the writer and not automatically inserted by the driver.&nbsp; However, I \n  do not agree with you that the half-letters should be relegated to&nbsp; word \n  art or special effects on the computer.&nbsp; The half-letters make quite \n  distinctive word outlines that appeal to me greatly.&nbsp; After much use of \n  QS, I feel confident in saying that they are no harder to read and are \n  automatically interpreted by the eye and brain in an appropriate \n  fashion.&nbsp; In fact, they might even be easier to read quickly since I \n  believe automatic word recognition, i.e. without having to break the word down \n  into its constituent letters for deciphering, is facilitated by unique \n  word-shapes.&nbsp; In any event, I feel a person who wishes to use \n  half-letters in his computer writing should be free to do so if he \n  chooses.&nbsp; If other people are put off by this or find it harder to read, \n  the writer will find it out by their comments to him. \n  <p>Your approach to the traditionally-written digraph letters will be quite \n  easy to learn.&nbsp; By the way, when I printed your proposed remapping out, \n  in place of Quikscript tall and deep &quot;x,&quot; I got the letter &quot;e.&quot;&nbsp; One with \n  an accent aigu and one with accent grave.&nbsp; Any idea why this \n  occurred?&nbsp; (As I told you previously, I have not used &quot;x&quot;&nbsp; in \n  writing in Jerome as I felt their inclusion in the alphabet somewhat \n  incongruous with Quikscript&#39;s rationale so I had not had this occur previously \n  in my writing.) \n  <p>Here is a problem I have noticed:&nbsp; If we type &quot;th&quot;, for example, in \n  the word &quot;hothouse,&quot; how does the driver know this should not be a &quot;thoth&quot; but \n  two separate letters?&nbsp; Admittedly, I doubt this would be a common \n  occurrence, but we should have a way to deal with it.&nbsp; There are probably \n  other English words that would cause similar problems that we are not aware of \n  yet. \n  <p>Could we somehow tell the driver to ignore the apparently flagged character \n  when it was inappropriately triggered?&nbsp; Could there be an &quot;undo&quot; key \n  that, if input immediately after the inappropriate flagged character, signals \n  the driver to correct the two preceding keystrokes to their normal outputs \n  rather than interpreting them as a flagged character?&nbsp; Perhaps the &quot;&lt;&quot; \n  character could be used, suggesting by its shape that the flagged character \n  should be opened back up to the two separate characters that were input. \n  <p>As I had proposed before, mapping the half-letters as flagged characters on \n  the same primary keys, i.e. half-tot on the &quot;t&quot; key and mapping &quot;Whitewheat&quot; \n  to &quot;q&quot; seems felicitous to me as it is logical and will foster quick learning \n  of the mapping. \n  <p>You commented in&nbsp; your post of 24 Feb.,&nbsp; that you love the \n  ligature letters.&nbsp; I also find them very attractive.&nbsp; Rather than \n  discarding them out of hand as you proposed due to the apparent scarcity of \n  available spots on the keyboard,&nbsp; I would suggest the following:&nbsp; \n  map the ligatures to the number keys at the top of the keyboard and trigger \n  their output with the &quot;j&quot; flag.&nbsp; In this manner the numbers and their \n  normal shift characters would still work, people who do not want to use the \n  ligatures could ignore them, and those of us who revel in their curvaceous \n  appearance can enjoy them in our writing.&nbsp;&nbsp; This sounds like a \n  win-win solution to me!&nbsp; I would map them to numbers 3 - 9 as this avoids \n  the use of the left hand little finger, which is weaker and shorter.&nbsp; To \n  extend this one last step:&nbsp; the two Gaelic letters could be mapped to &quot;1&quot; \n  and &quot;0,&quot; where they would bother no one, but would be available for Scottish \n  writers.&nbsp; Since the use of these letters would be minimal, having to \n  access them with right and left little fingers should not be too much of a \n  strain. \n  <p>Another difficulty I see with your proposal is&nbsp; in connection with the \n  vowels not mapped to a single key.&nbsp; I agree with the suggestion that they \n  be mapped with a flag that apes the typical spelling in traditional \n  orthography as this would simplify learning the mapping.&nbsp; However, we \n  probably need a test period to see how well the proposed letter combinations \n  will work in actuality. \n  <p>The driver will interpret the first letter typed as a standard QS letter \n  until the &quot;flag&quot; letter is typed so we have to insure that our flag does not \n  duplicate a pattern that normally occurs in English.&nbsp; As an example, you \n  proposed <br>the combination &quot;ah&quot; for the character &quot;Ah.&nbsp; But what if you \n  are trying to type the word &quot;ahead.&quot;&nbsp; You need a schwa followed by an \n  &quot;h,&quot; but the driver will interpret this as an &quot;Ah.&quot;&nbsp; Again, the idea of \n  an &quot;undo&quot; character as I suggested above would&nbsp; solve this (if that is \n  technically feasible), or we need to map another letter combination for \n  &quot;Ah.&quot;&nbsp; I have not given much thought to the other proposed letter \n  combinations for these vowels, but I would not be surprised if they also could \n  give rise to unexpected results. \n  <p>Let me know your thoughts on this. \n  <p>Thanks for your work, Jon. \n  <p>Sincerely, <br>&nbsp;

[snip]&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;I had reached that conclu=\r\nsion by the \n  time I sent the post that it wouldn&#39;t work for the reason yo=\r\nu discussed.&nbsp; \n  But your solution of using a key (&quot;j&quot;) as a &quot;flag&quot; to=\r\n alter the output of the \n  regular key will work just as well as what I ha=\r\nd proposed.&nbsp; I toyed \n  around with the idea of using &quot;f&quot; as a flag fo=\r\nr letters typed with the right \n  hand, but &quot;f&quot; can combine with too many o=\r\nther letters to form regular words so \n  I believe your choice of &quot;j&quot; as th=\r\ne single flag for the half-letters and \n  alternate &quot;n&quot; and &quot;x&quot; makes more =\r\nsense.&nbsp; The two letter combinations for \n  namer dot should work fine =\r\nin my opinion. \n  &lt;P&gt;I agree that the use of the half-letters should be lef=\r\nt to the discretion \n  of the writer and not automatically inserted by the =\r\ndriver.&nbsp; However, I \n  do not agree with you that the half-letters sho=\r\nuld be relegated to&nbsp; word \n  art or special effects on the computer.&n=\r\nbsp; The half-letters make quite \n  distinctive word outlines that appeal t=\r\no me greatly.&nbsp; After much use of \n  QS, I feel confident in saying tha=\r\nt they are no harder to read and are \n  automatically interpreted by the ey=\r\ne and brain in an appropriate \n  fashion.&nbsp; In fact, they might even be=\r\n easier to read quickly since I \n  believe automatic word recognition, i.e.=\r\n without having to break the word down \n  into its constituent letters for =\r\ndeciphering, is facilitated by unique \n  word-shapes.&nbsp; In any event, I=\r\n feel a person who wishes to use \n  half-letters in his computer writing sh=\r\nould be free to do so if he \n  chooses.&nbsp; If other people are put off b=\r\ny this or find it harder to read, \n  the writer will find it out by their c=\r\nomments to him. \n  &lt;P&gt;Your approach to the traditionally-written digraph le=\r\ntters will be quite \n  easy to learn.&nbsp; By the way, when I printed your=\r\n proposed remapping out, \n  in place of Quikscript tall and deep &quot;x,&quot; I got=\r\n the letter &quot;e.&quot;&nbsp; One with \n  an accent aigu and one with accent grave=\r\n.&nbsp; Any idea why this \n  occurred?&nbsp; (As I told you previously, I h=\r\nave not used &quot;x&quot;&nbsp; in \n  writing in Jerome as I felt their inclusion in=\r\n the alphabet somewhat \n  incongruous with Quikscript&#39;s rationale so I had =\r\nnot had this occur previously \n  in my writing.) \n  &lt;P&gt;Here is a problem I =\r\nhave noticed:&nbsp; If we type &quot;th&quot;, for example, in \n  the word &quot;hothouse,=\r\n&quot; how does the driver know this should not be a &quot;thoth&quot; but \n  two separate=\r\n letters?&nbsp; Admittedly, I doubt this would be a common \n  occurrence, b=\r\nut we should have a way to deal with it.&nbsp; There are probably \n  other =\r\nEnglish words that would cause similar problems that we are not aware of \n =\r\n yet. \n  &lt;P&gt;Could we somehow tell the driver to ignore the apparently flagg=\r\ned character \n  when it was inappropriately triggered?&nbsp; Could there be=\r\n an &quot;undo&quot; key \n  that, if input immediately after the inappropriate flagge=\r\nd character, signals \n  the driver to correct the two preceding keystrokes =\r\nto their normal outputs \n  rather than interpreting them as a flagged chara=\r\ncter?&nbsp; Perhaps the &quot;&lt;&quot; \n  character could be used, suggesting by it=\r\ns shape that the flagged character \n  should be opened back up to the two s=\r\neparate characters that were input. \n  &lt;P&gt;As I had proposed before, mapping=\r\n the half-letters as flagged characters on \n  the same primary keys, i.e. h=\r\nalf-tot on the &quot;t&quot; key and mapping &quot;Whitewheat&quot; \n  to &quot;q&quot; seems felicitous =\r\nto me as it is logical and will foster quick learning \n  of the mapping. \n =\r\n &lt;P&gt;You commented in&nbsp; your post of 24 Feb.,&nbsp; that you love the \n =\r\n ligature letters.&nbsp; I also find them very attractive.&nbsp; Rather tha=\r\nn \n  discarding them out of hand as you proposed due to the apparent scarci=\r\nty of \n  available spots on the keyboard,&nbsp; I would suggest the followi=\r\nng:&nbsp; \n  map the ligatures to the number keys at the top of the keyboar=\r\nd and trigger \n  their output with the &quot;j&quot; flag.&nbsp; In this manner the n=\r\numbers and their \n  normal shift characters would still work, people who do=\r\n not want to use the \n  ligatures could ignore them, and those of us who re=\r\nvel in their curvaceous \n  appearance can enjoy them in our writing.&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; This sounds like a \n  win-win solution to me!&nbsp; I would map them =\r\nto numbers 3 - 9 as this avoids \n  the use of the left hand little finger, =\r\nwhich is weaker and shorter.&nbsp; To \n  extend this one last step:&nbsp; t=\r\nhe two Gaelic letters could be mapped to &quot;1&quot; \n  and &quot;0,&quot; where they would b=\r\nother no one, but would be available for Scottish \n  writers.&nbsp; Since t=\r\nhe use of these letters would be minimal, having to \n  access them with rig=\r\nht and left little fingers should not be too much of a \n  strain. \n  &lt;P&gt;Ano=\r\nther difficulty I see with your proposal is&nbsp; in connection with the \n =\r\n vowels not mapped to a single key.&nbsp; I agree with the suggestion that =\r\nthey \n  be mapped with a flag that apes the typical spelling in traditional=\r\n \n  orthography as this would simplify learning the mapping.&nbsp; However,=\r\n we \n  probably need a test period to see how well the proposed letter comb=\r\ninations \n  will work in actuality. \n  &lt;P&gt;The driver will interpret the fir=\r\nst letter typed as a standard QS letter \n  until the &quot;flag&quot; letter is typed=\r\n so we have to insure that our flag does not \n  duplicate a pattern that no=\r\nrmally occurs in English.&nbsp; As an example, you \n  proposed &lt;BR&gt;the comb=\r\nination &quot;ah&quot; for the character &quot;Ah.&nbsp; But what if you \n  are trying to =\r\ntype the word &quot;ahead.&quot;&nbsp; You need a schwa followed by an \n  &quot;h,&quot; but th=\r\ne driver will interpret this as an &quot;Ah.&quot;&nbsp; Again, the idea of \n  an &quot;un=\r\ndo&quot; character as I suggested above would&nbsp; solve this (if that is \n  te=\r\nchnically feasible), or we need to map another letter combination for \n  &quot;A=\r\nh.&quot;&nbsp; I have not given much thought to the other proposed letter \n  com=\r\nbinations for these vowels, but I would not be surprised if they also could=\r\n \n  give rise to unexpected results. \n  &lt;P&gt;Let me know your thoughts on thi=\r\ns. \n  &lt;P&gt;Thanks for your work, Jon. \n  &lt;P&gt;Sincerely, &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;
