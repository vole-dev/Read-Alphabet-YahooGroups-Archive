The unstressed indefinite vowel. For which we assigned the set<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; COMMA to Utter<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; 2. The /V/ sound for which we assigned it STRUT<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; 3. When combined with Roe, it shares the /3/ sound. That is to<br/>\n&gt;  say for<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; the &quot;ligature&quot; Utter+Roe we assigned the lexical set NURSE<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; 1. COMMA<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Do not use the letter Utter for COMMA. Indeed do not have any letter<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; represent the indefinite vowel. Instead write the letter for the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; sound the vowel has when it is stressed in that same root. Write the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; &quot;mental image&quot; of the sound as it were. (sometimes of course this<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; turns out to be /V/ in which case one will use Utter after all (see<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; below))<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; - This has some whopping great advantages for morphemic writing: many<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; roots will no longer vary when suffixes are added:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; e.g.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; with the old approach we had:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; photography, photograph, photographer<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Fee+Owe+Tea+Ox+Gay+Roe...<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Fee+Owe+Tea+UTTER+Gay+Roe...<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Fee+Owe+Tea+Ox+Gay+Roe...<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; which very much damages readability compared to TO<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; But under the news system this and many other roots will be spelled<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; the same no mater the affixes.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; -It might actually be easier for writers to do this rather than<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; carefully notice the indefinite version of the vowel they are<br/>\n&gt;  writing.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; -When writers make mistakes I think it will mean inserting Utter<br/>\n&gt;  which<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; is the same as the old system anyway.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; -It does not fly in the face of the QM too very much<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Having said all that I must say I still have reservations because we<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; can not test it out properly. In order to do so would need countless<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; users to try to write using this rule and see if in fact it works.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; 2. STRUT<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Utter is still used for STRUT and it becomes its sole role.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; 3. NURSE<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Take NURSE away from the Utter+Roe combination. It is not the sound<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; the separate letters make and while it&#39;s close enough for us rhotics,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; it is untenable to ask non-rhotics to use the same symbol (Utter+Roe<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; ligature) for /3/ and /Vr/ (e.g. &quot;arrest&quot; vs &quot;nurse&quot;)<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; So this then leaves the question of where to put NURSE instead. I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; really strongly discourage adding a truly new letter under all<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; circumstances, it is an utterly immense undertaking. So we would<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; assign it to an existing letter and I would say that Roe works fine.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Thus: make Roe cover /r/ *and* the lexical set NURSE (which<br/>\n&gt;  implies /3/ )<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; -This trick worked for Ing, Read himself used it there (although we<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; expanded it a tad)<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; -The problem with the Utter-Roe &quot;ligature&quot; goes away. And if all<br/>\n&gt;  other<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Roe ligature problems can be accounted for with that &quot;Et/Eight,<br/>\n&gt;  It/Eat<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; , Foot/Ooze neutralization before Roe&quot; law. We have solved it all.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; -&quot;arrest&quot; is spelled Utter-Roe-Et-Sea-Tea. &quot;nurse&quot; is spelled<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; No-Roe-Sea. We already had &quot;being&quot; as Bay-Ing and &quot;king&quot; was now<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Key-Ing so it shouldn&#39;t be too shocking.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; My only concern is that this may be trouble for accents that strongly<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; roll their Rs; a rolled r is very different than /3/ and could be too<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; much to ask of them to use one letter for both. But as a humorous<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; aside we will now be able to directly transliterate<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Croatian place names like &quot;Krk&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",

When combined with Roe, it shares the /3/ sound. That is to\n&gt;  say for\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; the &quot;ligature&quot; Utter+Roe we assigned the lexical set NURSE\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; 1. COMMA\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Do not use the letter Utter for COMMA. Indeed do not have any letter\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; represent the indefinite vowel. Instead write the letter for the\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; sound the vowel has when it is stressed in that same root. Write the\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; &quot;mental image&quot; of the sound as it were. (sometimes of course this\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; turns out to be /V/ in which case one will use Utter after all (see\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; below))\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; - This has some whopping great advantages for morphemic writing: many\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; roots will no longer vary when suffixes are added:\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; e.g.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; with the old approach we had:\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; photography, photograph, photographer\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Fee+Owe+Tea+Ox+Gay+Roe...\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Fee+Owe+Tea+UTTER+Gay+Roe...\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Fee+Owe+Tea+Ox+Gay+Roe...\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; which very much damages readability compared to TO\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; But under the news system this and many other roots will be spelled\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; the same no mater the affixes.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; -It might actually be easier for writers to do this rather than\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; carefully notice the indefinite version of the vowel they are\n&gt;  writing.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; -When writers make mistakes I think it will mean inserting Utter\n&gt;  which\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; is the same as the old system anyway.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; -It does not fly in the face of the QM too very much\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Having said all that I must say I still have reservations because we\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; can not test it out properly. In order to do so would need countless\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; users to try to write using this rule and see if in fact it works.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; 2. STRUT\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Utter is still used for STRUT and it becomes its sole role.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; 3. NURSE\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Take NURSE away from the Utter+Roe combination. It is not the sound\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; the separate letters make and while it&#39;s close enough for us rhotics,\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; it is untenable to ask non-rhotics to use the same symbol (Utter+Roe\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; ligature) for /3/ and /Vr/ (e.g. &quot;arrest&quot; vs &quot;nurse&quot;)\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; So this then leaves the question of where to put NURSE instead. I&#39;d\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; really strongly discourage adding a truly new letter under all\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; circumstances, it is an utterly immense undertaking. So we would\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; assign it to an existing letter and I would say that Roe works fine.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Thus: make Roe cover /r/ *and* the lexical set NURSE (which\n&gt;  implies /3/ )\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; -This trick worked for Ing, Read himself used it there (although we\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; expanded it a tad)\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; -The problem with the Utter-Roe &quot;ligature&quot; goes away. And if all\n&gt;  other\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Roe ligature problems can be accounted for with that &quot;Et/Eight,\n&gt;  It/Eat\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; , Foot/Ooze neutralization before Roe&quot; law. We have solved it all.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; -&quot;arrest&quot; is spelled Utter-Roe-Et-Sea-Tea. &quot;nurse&quot; is spelled\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; No-Roe-Sea. We already had &quot;being&quot; as Bay-Ing and &quot;king&quot; was now\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Key-Ing so it shouldn&#39;t be too shocking.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; My only concern is that this may be trouble for accents that strongly\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; roll their Rs; a rolled r is very different than /3/ and could be too\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; much to ask of them to use one letter for both. But as a humorous\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; aside we will now be able to directly transliterate\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Croatian place names like &quot;Krk&quot;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n"
