Because it was written by a British-<br/>\nspeaking man, Quickscript does indeed show some bias towards the<br/>\ntraditional English way of pronounciation. &quot;Visual&quot;, for example, is<br/>\nspelled in the manual thusly: 10/26/12/17+40/36/24, whereas an<br/>\nAmerican would be inclined to spell it 10/26/_14_/...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis bias also makes for some interesting differences when using<br/>\nletters 32-34, which to our ears are all pronounced the same. As<br/>\nnear as I can tell, there should be no need for an American to use<br/>\nletter 34 at ALL, save that it abbreviates &quot;on&quot;. I have made this<br/>\nchoice based upon my research so far. 33 is useful to American<br/>\nenglish speakers not as an &quot;ah&quot; sound, but as the o-spelled sound<br/>\nthat directly preceeds &quot;r&quot; in such words as &quot;or&quot; &quot;north&quot; &quot;sore&quot;,<br/>\netc... examples from the Quickscript manual confirm this usage.<br/>\n<br/>\nLetter 20 is also unused by Americans, but serves as a nice<br/>\nabbreviation for &quot;what&quot;. In fact, I would be inclined to say that<br/>\nboth 20 AND 34 could be stricken from the alphabet for all english<br/>\nspeakers and Readscript would not suffer because of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my purposes, all &quot;ah&quot; sounds I spell with 32, all &quot;o[r]&quot; sounds I<br/>\nspell with 33, and 34 is utterly unused, save to abbreviate &quot;on&quot;,<br/>\nwhich I am considering dropping as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will doubtless cause some people to get up-in-arms, but I am<br/>\nalso interested in the discourse, and if I am wrong, then this will<br/>\nnot be the first time. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Andy</div>",
