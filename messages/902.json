About 1974, I also wrote to <br/>\nKingsley Read, but my correspondence with him was very brief.  He <br/>\nsupplied me with the names of two people who were interested in <br/>\ncorresponding -- one in New Zealand and one in Oregon or Washington <br/>\nstate here in the U.S.  The latter person is a member of this group <br/>\nalthough he has not written in quite some time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAround 1999, after I found a group promoting Shavian, as they call the <br/>\nalphabet which won the contest held due to Shaw&#39;s will, I talked to <br/>\npeople in that group regarding QS, but found they had little interest in <br/>\nit.  Some of their members were developing computer fonts so that <br/>\nShavian could be typed on their computers, but no one was interested in <br/>\ndoing the same for QS.  I did not have the necessary expertise to design <br/>\na QS font so I stayed in the Shavian group for the time being.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first became a member, I expected more interest to be shown in QS <br/>\nsince I viewed it as the tested and revised version of Shavian.  It <br/>\nquickly became obvious that the Shavian group did not see things that <br/>\nway.  To most of them, QS was an ill-advised revision of Read&#39;s work -- <br/>\nsort of a heresy, in fact.  I was told that the publication of <br/>\n_Androcles and the Lion_ in the bi-alphabetic format had given Shavian <br/>\nso much more publicity than QS had been able to achieve that it made no <br/>\nsense to champion QS.  This is a viewpoint I did not and do not agree <br/>\nwith.  If the designer of the alphabet felt the his initial attempt <br/>\n(Shavian) needed improvement to make it fully practicable among <br/>\nEnglish-speaking communities around the world, which I assume was his <br/>\nrationale for releasing QS to the world, then it makes little sense to <br/>\ncontinue using and promoting the &quot;beta&quot; form of the alphabet.  I was <br/>\ntold that switching to QS would toss aside the progress they had made.  <br/>\nOf course at that time, the Shavian group had about 100 members, if <br/>\nmemory serves, so the &quot;progress&quot; had not been exactly overwhelming.<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally became sufficiently exasperated with the comments made about <br/>\nQS in the Shavian group and their lack of interest that I resolved to <br/>\nstart the Read_Alphabet (RA) group myself in late November, 2000.    Jon <br/>\nZuck, one of our members (he designed the first QS font), tried to <br/>\ndissuade me from it.  I believe he was concerned that it would splinter <br/>\nthe interest in alternative English alphabets between the two groups, <br/>\nbut, in fact, RA has done quite well.  We have over 300 members now.  I <br/>\nwould like to see the group continue to grow.  RA seems to attract a <br/>\nsomewhat different type of member than Shavian does.  They love to <br/>\ndebate every miniscule aspect of Shavian, but the feeling I have is that <br/>\nmost of our members seem more interested in using the alphabet as a tool <br/>\nand less interested in the theory behind it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to the difficulties of getting various varieties of browsers to work <br/>\nproperly with QS fonts, we tend to write in the Roman alphabet, or as it <br/>\nis sometimes called, traditional orthography (TO), which is ironic.  I <br/>\nbelieve that lots of practice is needed to increase reading speed and if <br/>\nit were easier to write in QS over the internet, that would make it <br/>\nsimpler for people to improve their QS skills.  I still am not <br/>\ncompletely happy with the QS fonts we have available, although Kingsley <br/>\nis quite good.  Jerome - the first font for QS -- will even let you use <br/>\nhalf-letters, but there was a problem at times with the spacing of the <br/>\nletters and the positioning of the cursor.  There is information on the <br/>\ngroup site that tells you how to use the fonts.  Another issue is that <br/>\nstandard keyboards don&#39;t have enough keys for QS so the issue of how to <br/>\nset up the keyboard has found different solutions.  I don&#39;t think an <br/>\nideal has been reached there either. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope the foregoing has given you some background of our group.  I am <br/>\nsure that members of the group would enjoy reading some of your <br/>\nreminiscences of your correspondence with Kingsley Read.
