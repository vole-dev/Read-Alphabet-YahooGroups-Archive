The biggest problem I \n  see is not that the<br>&gt; script is difficult to read, but that individuals \n  decide to start making<br>&gt; the letters differently than the QS manual sets \n  out. For instance, in<br>&gt; your e-mail you comment that &quot;other people have \n  their unique connections<br>&gt; to the letters.&quot; This ignores the fact that \n  the manual does not<br>&gt; authorize &quot;unique connections&quot; in forming the \n  letters. When one letter<br>&gt; that ends where another starts, one does not \n  have to make a pen-lift.<br>&gt; When they do not end at the same point, a \n  pen-lift should always be made<br>&gt; because the shape of the QS letters are \n  simpler than T.O. and additional<br>&gt; connecting lines added willy-nilly at \n  the writer&#39;s whim will inevitably<br>&gt; cause legibility to suffer.

Shavian is a<br>&gt; script with no connections between letters so what \n  does &quot;best printed&quot;<br>&gt; mean? It only has what we term a &quot;printed&quot; form, \n  i.e. no cursive form<br>&gt; of Shavian exists.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; From: \n  stbett<br>&gt; &gt; Sent: 8/31/2002 8:01:08 AM<br>&gt; &gt; To: \n  Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com<br>&gt; &gt; Subject: [Read_Alphabet] Re: NBC \n  English - oh, and Hi everyone<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Hi Grant, welcome to \n  the group.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Issue #1: Shouldn&#39;t the base dialect be \n  more neutral?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Just because there is a base dialect \n  does not mean that you have to<br>&gt; &gt; speak that way.

I don&#39;t think the<br>&gt; \n  &gt; issue is proper pronunciation. It is more a case of a \n  pronunciation<br>&gt; &gt; that will be widely understood.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  Everyone seems convinced that the use of QS or Shavian will require a<br>&gt; \n  standardized spelling, which I feel is a hangover from the current<br>&gt; \n  situation with T.O. I remain unconvinced. In my opinion, as soon as<br>&gt; \n  you standardize the spelling, and people pronounce the words in the \n  way<br>&gt; they are accustomed to, the alphabet stops being a relatively \n  accurate<br>&gt; representation of speech and over time the divergence between \n  spoken<br>&gt; English and written English will inevitably increase, and given \n  enough<br>&gt; time, we will be back in the same boat we are in now. If we \n  would keep<br>&gt; the spoken and written forms closely together, then some \n  group would<br>&gt; have to be given authority to change the &quot;official&quot; \n  spelling of words,<br>&gt; and the English-speaking world has no such \n  group.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If I, as an American, can understand Australian \n  English or British<br>&gt; English when spoken, I surely should be able to \n  understand it when<br>&gt; written in QS. In fact, I corresponded with an New \n  Zealand native in QS<br>&gt; in 1974 and had absolutely no problem \n  understanding what he had written,<br>&gt; and we had no &quot;standardized \n  spelling.&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Really obscure English dialects will probably not \n  appear in print that<br>&gt; often in any event, and, if they did, and people \n  could not comprehend<br>&gt; them, presumably the authors of such works would \n  learn about that in<br>&gt; short order and make the necessary changes to \n  alter their orthography to<br>&gt; the closest main-stream dialect.<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Paige Gabhart<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  ------------------------ Yahoo!

The biggest problem I \n  see is not =\r\nthat the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; script is difficult to read, but that individuals \n  decid=\r\ne to start making&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the letters differently than the QS manual sets \n=\r\n  out. For instance, in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; your e-mail you comment that &quot;other people =\r\nhave \n  their unique connections&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to the letters.&quot; This ignores the =\r\nfact that \n  the manual does not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; authorize &quot;unique connections&quot; in =\r\nforming the \n  letters. When one letter&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that ends where another sta=\r\nrts, one does not \n  have to make a pen-lift.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When they do not end =\r\nat the same point, a \n  pen-lift should always be made&lt;BR&gt;&gt; because the =\r\nshape of the QS letters are \n  simpler than T.O. and additional&lt;BR&gt;&gt; con=\r\nnecting lines added willy-nilly at \n  the writer&#39;s whim will inevitably&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; cause legibility to suffer. One \n  should not make connecting lines&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; between letters that do not join \n  naturally. To do so is to revert =\r\nback&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to the practices of writing in \n  Roman.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Shav=\r\nian Script is best printed as it is quite \n  clear.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The me=\r\naning of the preceding sentence is unclear to \n  me. Shavian is a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; s=\r\ncript with no connections between letters so what \n  does &quot;best printed&quot;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; mean? It only has what we term a &quot;printed&quot; form, \n  i.e. no cursive f=\r\norm&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of Shavian exists.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: \n  stbett&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Sent: 8/31/2002 8:01:08 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: \n  Read_Alphabet@yahoogr=\r\noups.com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [Read_Alphabet] Re: NBC \n  English - oh, and=\r\n Hi everyone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Grant, welcome to \n  the group.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Issue #1: Shouldn&#39;t the base dialect be \n  more ne=\r\nutral?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Just because there is a base dialect \n  do=\r\nes not mean that you have to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; speak that way. It does mean that=\r\n \n  you have to be familiar with the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dialect if that is the ba=\r\nsis of \n  standardized spelling.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; snip...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; It will \n  be much easier for all to phonemically spell as an NBC&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; \n  commentator speaks than as Queen Elizabeth spoke. I don&#39;t think=\r\n the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; issue is proper pronunciation. It is more a case of a =\r\n\n  pronunciation&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that will be widely understood.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; \n  Everyone seems convinced that the use of QS or Shavian will require =\r\na&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  standardized spelling, which I feel is a hangover from the cur=\r\nrent&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  situation with T.O. I remain unconvinced. In my opinion, as=\r\n soon as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  you standardize the spelling, and people pronounce the =\r\nwords in the \n  way&lt;BR&gt;&gt; they are accustomed to, the alphabet stops bein=\r\ng a relatively \n  accurate&lt;BR&gt;&gt; representation of speech and over time t=\r\nhe divergence between \n  spoken&lt;BR&gt;&gt; English and written English will in=\r\nevitably increase, and given \n  enough&lt;BR&gt;&gt; time, we will be back in the=\r\n same boat we are in now. If we \n  would keep&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the spoken and writte=\r\nn forms closely together, then some \n  group would&lt;BR&gt;&gt; have to be given=\r\n authority to change the &quot;official&quot; \n  spelling of words,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and the E=\r\nnglish-speaking world has no such \n  group.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If I, as an Am=\r\nerican, can understand Australian \n  English or British&lt;BR&gt;&gt; English whe=\r\nn spoken, I surely should be able to \n  understand it when&lt;BR&gt;&gt; written =\r\nin QS. In fact, I corresponded with an New \n  Zealand native in QS&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nin 1974 and had absolutely no problem \n  understanding what he had written,=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and we had no &quot;standardized \n  spelling.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Really =\r\nobscure English dialects will probably not \n  appear in print that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\noften in any event, and, if they did, and people \n  could not comprehend&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; them, presumably the authors of such works would \n  learn about that =\r\nin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; short order and make the necessary changes to \n  alter their ort=\r\nhography to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the closest main-stream dialect.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Paige Gabhart&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  ------------------------ =\r\nYahoo!
