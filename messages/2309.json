  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1518014297\">Sid and Tim,<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have only been studying Shavian and QS (which I call Quickscript Shavian) for only a couple of months. But I must say that QS seems, to me, far easier to read and write.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven Read stated he went back to revise what didn&#39;t work with Shavian, and I feel that QS addressed many of the flaws of the original Shavian (which probably explains why Quickstript is sometimes referred to Shavian 2. Although I feel calling it Quickscript Shavian is fair tribute to both the scripts originators).<br/>\n<br/>\nQS is designed to be more fluid in writing, and has many more ligatures. In fact, there is even ligature shortening. At first this confused me, but as I became accustomed to it I realized it made much more sense to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver all, QS is so well designed that when I went back to original Shavian I realized how rough it really was. It makes sense though, since Read basically IMPROVED the original Shavian template.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that QS could be adopted by English users far easier than Shavian for numerous reasons. It shares a lot in common with Japanese Kana forms as well as Korean in terms of writability and readibility. It is much easier to write. The shorting of ing using ng and the ligatures and half hooks make it easier to read and write. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing left handed I noticed something else about QS that is amazing. The left to right strokes, which Read says are preferable whenever a letter can be written two ways, makes the written form of QS extremely easy for lefties like me to pick up.<br/>\n<br/>\nShavian, although a beautiful script, is not designed for lefties and gives me too much resistance when writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, those are just a few of my thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nTristan Vick<br/>\nHave a Happy New Year everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sid Tanaban &lt;sidban2@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I couldn&#39;t read anything - even the fonts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Tim &lt;rubik67@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Monday, December 31, 2012 11:10 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [Read_Alphabet] Re: Shaw Alphabet Books is now online.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;\u00c2\u00a0 <br/>\n&gt; &gt;--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sid Tanaban &lt;sidban2@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; A happy new year to you, Tim!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And to you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I went to your book on Poe and Shaw but it was too black to read <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; anything about your new book. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Interesting.

When I saw the Shaw Alphabet for the first time back on April 16th, 2002, I thought it was one of the most beautiful writing systems I&#39;d ever seen, so much so that 2 days later I became determined to do something about it when I found out that it was the only book published in the alphabet. Quikskript... not so much. I read through the QuikSkript guide and ended up with more questions than answers. I found it really confusing and there appeared to be many instances where things that look identical could be pronounced differently. For example, Read said that you could use the ng character to represent the suffix -ing. For example, would Commander Data&#39;s creator be Noonien Soong, or Noonien Suing? In the Shaw Alphabet it&#39;s obvious, but in the Read Alphabet you can never be sure. I have the same basic issue with Paul Vandenbrink&#39;s &quot;Shaw Alphabet&quot; in how he merged ALL of the vowels into<br/>\n&gt;  2-3 characters, so good luck trying to read a story about the 5 sisters Jane, Jan, Jen, Joan, June and their brother John.
