I am designing a replacement truetype font for Jerome. <br/>\nThis new font (called KINGSLEY.TTF) will include (among other things)<br/>\na more intuitive keyboard layout based on a one-to-one conversion<br/>\nbetween the sounds of T.O. and Readscript, characters with standard<br/>\nstroke widths and joining points, and kerning pairs that provide what<br/>\nI perceive to be the best representation of the way Readscript was<br/>\nmeant to be written.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor consistency&#39;s sake, I am currently going to be the only active<br/>\ndeveloper until the font reaches a suitable beta release state, but I<br/>\nwould like the input and participation of all Readscript enthusiasts<br/>\nin this endeavor, such that we can truely have a font written<br/>\nby-enthusiasts-for-enthusiasts and one that we can all have some<br/>\namount of personal involvement and satisfaction in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are, of course, stumbling blocks to be overcome and questions<br/>\nabout standardization that need to be asked, so I have decided to ask<br/>\nthem here and now (even though the characters are only about halfway<br/>\nfinished).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo kick things off, my first question to the quickscript community<br/>\nregards the joining of characters to letter #25/Roe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs is plainly seen, the character was designed with two joining<br/>\npoints, both of which are incoming points and exist on the same<br/>\nx-plane.  It shares the first of these properties with #22/May, and<br/>\nshares both of these properties with only one other character:<br/>\n#37/OUt. This introduces problems in font design when being connected<br/>\nto by any characters that cross into the x-plane through or beyond<br/>\nboth joining sites (i.e. #&#39;s 3, 7, 10, 14, 26, 27).  When examined<br/>\nfurther, however, one notes that most of these characters would NEVER<br/>\njoin to #25, except perhaps #7 or #27.  I have noticed on page 13 of<br/>\nthe Quickscript Manual that there seemes to be an extra character #36<br/>\nin the example &quot;mere&quot; (27-36-25).  Is this really #36, or one of the<br/>\n&quot;confusing linking strokes&quot; that Read talks about?  If it IS #36, is<br/>\nthis because of English pronunciation?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, and I look forward to further input in participation in this<br/>\nproject</div>",
