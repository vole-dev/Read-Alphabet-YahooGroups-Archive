Moreover some accents in<br/>\n&gt; Britain have a true diphthong /IU/ wherever other accents<br/>\n&gt; have &#39;long _u_&#39;, including words like _lute_ and _rude_, so<br/>\n&gt; that for them a spelling with a {j} in these words will be<br/>\n&gt; as inappropriate as a spelling which renders _u_ in _tune_<br/>\n&gt; and _lute_ differently.
