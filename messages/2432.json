  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1615442460\">The discussion is basically about two different scenarios: <br/>\n1. The current sitaution<br/>\n2. If the English language adopted Quikscript<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first case, I think it makes great sense for us all to write the way we each speak. Otherwise we end up in a confusing situation, where for example, I would keep forgetting half the time that I&#39;m supposed to write &quot;tut-yoyo-ooze-nun&quot; instead of &quot;tut-ooze-nun&quot; and &quot;haha-ah-fife&quot; in place of &quot;haha-ash-fife&quot; and countless other differences that would be totally illogical to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the second case, I think we would all inevitably gravitate to national standards for our orthography (globalization notwithstanding), with personal pronunciation as an optional alternate spelling for certain uses. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis clustering of orthography by country might lead us to no longer speak of English as a single language -- just as Danish and Swedish are referred to as different languages even though they&#39;re mutually intelligible. In my own case it would be pretty easy, because any differences between my own speech and Standard American (English) are pretty minimal.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was just starting to learn Quickscript, it was a real challenge for me to read the sample texts at the end of the Manual, because while I was still learning to recognize and sound out the letters, I had to simultaneously &quot;decode&quot; a foreign dialect. At first I wondered why it&#39;s so hard to read another dialect, even though I can understand Queens Received English very easily when I hear it spoken. I think the answer is just that it&#39;s something I&#39;m accustomed to: I&#39;ve heard that dialect so much in my life that it&#39;s easy to understand; if I were a reader of Standard American QS orthography and I often read things written in QRE, then reading that dialect would become easy for me too.</div>",
