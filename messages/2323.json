Unstandardized QS does not affect understandability.  \nSo if that is the case then it should not be a problem for people to \nwrite as they speak.

But it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; clear that Read designed his script so that everyone would write the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; same way, which is why he insists that words like START are \n&gt; written with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Are, not with Ah, even though almost everybody outside North America\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pronounces them the same way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, in most cases you don&#39;t have to distinguish awe from ah from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;ox&quot;. Those three symbols look visually similar for a reason. \n&gt; It&#39;s so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that when you&#39;re writing you can just sort of blur them together and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people will still know how to pronounce what you wrote.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Every English-speaker outside of North America makes a three-way\n&gt; &gt; &gt; distinction, and about 50% of the people in the U.S. make a two-way\n&gt; &gt; &gt; distinction: for most of us, Ox = Ah, but in Eastern New England \n&gt; Ox = Awe.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Values of beeta will give rise to dom!

I use it to write my journal. &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; But it can either be phonetic or it can be\n              standardized &iuml;&iquest;&frac12; it cannot be both. To standardize QS is\n              to start making the same mistake that brought modern\n              English spelling to the state it&#39;s in. Once writing is\n              divorced from pronunciation, then the writing is about\n              something else. For example,the three day gathering whose\n              name is pronounced &quot;wick&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;d fair&quot; is written &quot;Wicked\n              Faire&quot;. Here, spelling is used to say something\n              non-linguistic about the gathering.&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; There is a quicker solution to the spelling problem\n              than adopting QS: it&#39;s called &quot;spelling pronunciation&quot;.\n              That&#39;s where the T pronounced in &quot;often&quot; comes from. It&#39;s\n              why I make a distinction between eh-ffect and ae-ffect,\n              wailing and whaling. In other words, it is by forcing a\n              correspondence between writing and pronunciation and turn\n              TO into a phonetic system.&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; Vin&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; --- In &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n                href=&quot;mailto:Read_Alphabet%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;,\n              John Cowan wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; fern.wing169 scripsit:&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; &gt; No-- &#39;wh&#39; isn&#39;t always used before why.
