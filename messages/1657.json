I use all three sounds: Awl, Ah and On. In\nfact, I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; really don&#39;t understand what some people mean when they say they\ncan&#39;t hear&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the difference between Awl and On. It strikes me in a similar way\nas if&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; they said they can&#39;t distinguish between blue and green.\nObviously, the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; boundary between the two colors is somewhat ambiguous, but most of\nus have a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; clear enough idea of what blue is versus what green is.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I have thought that those who say they can&#39;t hear the difference\nactually&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; just means they don&#39;t use the Awl sound, i.e. they pronounce words\nsuch as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;all&quot; with the On sound. I expect that they can hear the\ndifference if they&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; listen closely to someone pronouncing Awl versus On even if it is\nnot a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; distinction they make in their own speech.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This whole thread seems to have started as a method to enable a\ndictionary&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to have all spelling variants placed together alphabetically.\nRather than&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; throwing out a phoneme that many of us feel quite strongly about,\nit makes&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; more sense to me that if there is a variant spelling that will not\nbe next&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to the others simply put in a note directing the reader to the\nother&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; spelling as in: &quot;see also: _______.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I also feel strongly about the continued availability of &quot;Wh&quot;. I\nam sure&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that those who don&#39;t use it don&#39;t miss it, but I can assure you\nreading the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; QS news with nary a &quot;wh&quot; to be seen is noticed by me every time I\ncome&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; across a word where I would use it. I actually seem more aware of\nits&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; absence in writing than I am in hearing others who don&#39;t use &quot;wh&quot;\nin their&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; speech.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Paige&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Moira O&#39;Brien wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; As a speaker of RP, I can&#39;t agree to the merger of Awl Ah and On.\nMy&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; pronunciation makes full use of all three as distinct sounds.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It also does with Wool &amp; Ooze but losing one of those two\nwould not be much&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of a hardship.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The distinction between those sounds is quite small and not\nsignificant and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is very much like the different sounds of Schwa.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Moira&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--------------010000010309070902010802--\r\n\n"
