Also, your lips are nice<br/>\nand open, so the doctor can see right in. To me, /A./ sounds a lot<br/>\ndifferent, but it is really the same exact sound as /A/, but with the<br/>\nlips rounded. The only way I can describe /O/ is by saying that it is<br/>\nalso prounced like /A./, but with the tongue slightly higher.
