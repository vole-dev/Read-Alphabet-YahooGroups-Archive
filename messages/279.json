Is there\n&gt; &gt;a &quot;standard&quot; Read form for each English word, or would one simply\n&gt; &gt;write the words as his or her dialect pronounces them?\n&gt; &gt;      If these questions have been answered anywhere else on board,\n&gt; &gt;could someone direct me to the thread they&#39;re in?  Thanks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Ryan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;      Hello everyone.  :)  I&#39;m a new to the board; I just \ndiscovered\n&gt; &gt;the Read Alphabet the other day on Omniglot.com and I was \nfascinated\n&gt; &gt;by the idea of using a different script to write English.  I&#39;ve got\n&gt; &gt;most of the letters down (at least in its &quot;junior&quot; form), but there\n&gt; &gt;are some letters that I&#39;m not sure how to use, and some sounds for\n&gt; &gt;which I&#39;m not sure which letter to use, for instance the \ncommon &quot;er&quot;\n&gt; &gt;suffix, as in &quot;maker&quot;. \n&gt; &gt;      Also, I was wondering how users of the alphabet deal with\n&gt; &gt;different pronounciations due to differences in dialect.  Is there\n&gt; &gt;a &quot;standard&quot; Read form for each English word, or would one simply\n&gt; &gt;write the words as his or her dialect pronounces them?\n&gt; &gt;      If these questions have been answered anywhere else on board,\n&gt; &gt;could someone direct me to the thread they&#39;re in?  Thanks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Ryan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; - Robert McBroom\n&gt;    Manager\n&gt;    Onteora Mountain House\n&gt;    Boiceville NY\n&gt;    845-657-6233\n\n\n\n\nwow it seems that omniglot is taking over the scholarly underground \nby storm as i too have found quickscript on it. any advice would be \nawsome..new to this today. thanks\nas always\nsam\n\n\n"
