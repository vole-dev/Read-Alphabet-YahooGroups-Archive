In Holland there is English everywhere. We never d=\r\nub on TV. Always \nsubtitles, except for kiddies who can&#39;t read yet. Commerc=\r\nials on TV are 100% \nEnglish, special terms are English because they sound =\r\ncooler (even if they have \nno international character, such as the &#39;Traffic=\r\n Information Centre&#39;, which \nreports traffic jams in Holland only on the ra=\r\ndio.)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;The problem with German is =\r\nthat you never need it, \nexcept to show those tourists the way (which is ra=\r\nre too). German words look \nlike Dutch words but mean totally different thi=\r\nngs. German has explicit \nindication of cases, something that doesn&#39;t occur=\r\n in Dutch and English. And \nfinally, it has three genders (der, die, das). =\r\nEnglish has no genders, and Dutch \nalso has three, but merges too (de, het)=\r\n. These genders are not the same in \nGerman and Dutch.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT =\r\nface=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Holland is so full of English it doesn&#39;t really pose =\r\n\na problem for us. Most Dutch people will understand your English, and if y=\r\nou try \nto speak Dutch, they will ask you to speak English. But not every D=\r\nutch person \ncan speak proper English though. But you will be understood.&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I am always discovering mispronunc=\r\niations in my own \nspeech.
