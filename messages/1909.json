People may find it<br/>\nattractive in spite of the fact that it will constitute a<br/>\ncompromise between an ASCII transliteration *of<br/>\nQuikscript* and yet another quasi-phonemic ASCII<br/>\ntranscription of English.<br/>\n<br/>\n    mappings which differ between BPJ 1 and BPJ 2.1<br/>\n<br/>\n| QS # |(Jerome)| Name        | BPJ 1| BPJ 2.1     |<br/>\n|------|--------|-------------|------|-------------|<br/>\n| #14  | Z      | J&#39;ai        | Z    | J *         |<br/>\n| #16  | J      | Jay         | J    | j *         |<br/>\n| #17  | j      | Ye          | j    | y *         |<br/>\n| #31  | F      | I           | A *  | Y *         |<br/>\n| #32  | y      | Ah          | q *  | A *         |<br/>\n| #35  | q      | Oy          | O *  | q           |<br/>\n| #36  | a      | Utter       | y *  | u *         |<br/>\n| #37  | Q      | Out         | Y *  | B *         |<br/>\n| #39  | U      | Foot        | u *  | V *         |<br/>\n| #38  | O      | Owe         | B *  | O           |<br/>\n| #36.2| u      | Up          | V *  | C *         |<br/>\n| #12.5| L      | half-Zoo    | C *  | Z *         |<br/>\n<br/>\n    Quikscript-ASCII as a transliteration<br/>\n<br/>\nAny mapping of Quikscript letters to ASCII letters will in<br/>\neffect be a transliteration, and as such it must be easy<br/>\nto read even if displayed in a normal ASCII font rather<br/>\nthan a Quikscript font, because there will be times, more<br/>\nor less frequent, when we will be reading transcribed text<br/>\nwithout having the time or opportunity to view it in a<br/>\nQuikscript font.<br/>\n<br/>\n    The signalling function of capitalization<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more I think of it the more convinced I get that in an<br/>\nASCII mapping of Quikscript the ASCII lowercase letters<br/>\nshould as far as possible be mapped to their regular<br/>\nTraditional Orthography sounds - say their sounds as they<br/>\nwould say when teaching spelling in school - while the ASCII<br/>\nuppercase letters should be used to signal their own<br/>\notherness.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Other vowel mappings<br/>\n<br/>\n     The lowercase ASCII vowel letters<br/>\n<br/>\nFor that reason the five lowercase vowel letters _i, e, a,<br/>\no, u_ should be mapped to #26, #28, #30, #34, #36, _j_ and<br/>\n_y_ to #16 and #17 and so on for all the Traditional<br/>\nOrthography single letters which have a default phoneme<br/>\ncorrespondence.<br/>\n<br/>\n     The ASCII uppercase vowel letters<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the system of marking Quikscript paired vowels with<br/>\ncapitalization has been abandoned by the remapping of {u}<br/>\nand {y} there is no point in keeping ASCII {A, O, Y} for<br/>\n#31, #35, #37; indeed these mappings become more misleading<br/>\nthan the old uppercase {F} for #31, since people will expect<br/>\nthem to be mapped to vowels, but these sounds are never<br/>\nwritten with these Traditional Orthography letters, unlike<br/>\n_I_ and _E_ which at least map to the sounds of #27 and #29<br/>\nin recent french loans like _machine_ and _ballet_. It<br/>\nbecomes better to use uppercase {Y} for #31, since this<br/>\nletter and sound are associated in Traditional Orthography<br/>\n(_my, rye, edify, hyphen_). It is also obviously better to<br/>\nmap ASCII uppercase {A} to #32, since this sound is always<br/>\nwritten _a_ in accents like RP which maintain the three-way<br/>\ncontrast between #32, #33, #34. In the same vein ASCII<br/>\nuppercase {O} can be conveniently mapped to #38, which is<br/>\n&#39;the long sound of _o_&#39; in Traditional Orthography. For #33<br/>\nwe will map uppercase {Q} also in this mapping, if onlu<br/>\nbecause we will need to map _Q_ to some Quikscript letter,<br/>\nand at least uppercase {Q} looks like uppercase {O} with a<br/>\nsquiggle, just like #33 looks like #34 with a squiggle!<br/>\n<br/>\n     Quikscript vowel letters mapped to ASCII consonant<br/>\n     letters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will leave ASCII {q} as the odd man out among the ASCII<br/>\nlowercase letters; I have mapped it to #35, not only because<br/>\nit is the old mapping, but also because lowercase _q_ does<br/>\nhave some similarity, to the Quikscript letter itself \u2014 a<br/>\nloop with a downwards tail to the right \u2014 as well as to the<br/>\nTraditional Orthography digraph _oy_.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith lowercase {u} mapped to #36 some other ASCII letter<br/>\nmust be found for #39, and after some consideration I have<br/>\ncome to the conclusion that uppercase {V}, as proposed by<br/>\nTed Larson freeman, is indeed the best choice: it looks<br/>\nsimilar to the Quikscript letter, and historically the<br/>\nTraditional Orthography letters _U_ and _V_[^3] were variant<br/>\nforms of the same letter.<br/>\n<br/>\nASCII uppercase {B} will still be mapped to a vowel, and<br/>\nnow memory-cued to the word &quot;bout&quot;, and probably those who<br/>\nare familiar with the _&#x0223;_ ligature form of the _ou_<br/>\ndigraph will be aided by its visual similarity to<br/>\nuppercase _B_.<br/>\n<br/>\nI choose to map ASCII uppercase {C} to alternate #36, since<br/>\nTed Larson Freeman brought the graphic similarity between<br/>\nthese letters of the two alphabets to attention, and with<br/>\n{V} mapped to #39 no other of the available uppercase letter<br/>\nfits better. That uppercase {C} is more readable than<br/>\nlowercase in this role, especially next to {k}, because<br/>\ncapitalization serves to signal that C does not have any of<br/>\nthe usual sound values of Traditional Orthography c, nor,<br/>\nindeed, marks a vowel is easily seen by comparing {skClpcur,<br/>\nakCmpliS, surkCs, kClcurCl, kCstCm} (or {kCsFCm}) with<br/>\n{skclpCur, akcmpliS, surkcs, kclCurcl, kcstcm} (or {kcsFcm})<br/>\nfor _sculpture, accomplish, circus, cultural, custom_. There<br/>\nare, not counting derivations, some 30 words where #5 and<br/>\n#15 occur next to each other[^4], but I deem these to be of<br/>\nfar less text frequency than in particular the combinations<br/>\n#36+#24 and #36+#22, espescially if one considers that<br/>\nseveral of these words have alternative pronunciations with<br/>\n#3+#17 instead of #15, and thus should perhaps be spelled<br/>\naccordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Consonant mappings<br/>\n<br/>\nThe remaining Quikscript letters must and should be mapped<br/>\nto uppercase ASCII letters. The Traditional Orthography<br/>\nequivalents of these Quikscript letters will normally be<br/>\ndigraphs, and as a general principle the uppercase ASCII<br/>\ncharacter choosen to represent them should correspond to<br/>\none of the letters of these digraph. There will, even must,<br/>\nbe deviations from this principle, but these should be well<br/>\ngrounded and provided with good memory-cues. As it turns<br/>\nout only _T, S, W_ for #7, #13, #20 will more or less<br/>\nunproblematically follow this principle. Analogy then<br/>\nsuggests that _D, C, Z, N_ be mapped to #8, #14, #15, #21,<br/>\nbut again it turns out that only {D} #8 will stand<br/>\nrelatively unaffected by other considerations. Traditional<br/>\nOrthography never writes the sound of #8 with a spelling<br/>\ncontaining the letter _d_, but the analogy to _T_ for #7 is<br/>\nrelatively flawless here. Not so with the sound of #14:<br/>\nspellings with _z_ corresponding to this sound are<br/>\nvirtually confined to the use of _zh_ in transcribed<br/>\nRussian names. The Traditional Orthography consonant letter<br/>\nmost regularly associated with this sound is actually _s_,<br/>\nbut there is another Traditional Orthography letter which<br/>\nis fairly regularly associated with the sound, namely _j_<br/>\nin recent French loan words. This suggests uppercase {J} as<br/>\nthe best mapping for #14, as does the fact that words like<br/>\ngarage and mirage have variant pronunciations with #16.<br/>\nThere is also the fact to consider that uppercase ASCII<br/>\nletters which don&#39;t get mapped to basic or alternate<br/>\nletters will almost inevitably end up mapped to half-<br/>\nletters, whether we include those in our &#39;official&#39;<br/>\nproposals or not, and it seems much better to map the ASCII<br/>\nuppercase {Z} to the frequently used half-z and ASCII<br/>\nuppercase {J} to #14 than the other way around!<br/>\n<br/>\nWith #21 the problem is somewhat different. What causes<br/>\nproblems here is that ASCII uppercase {N} is clearly the<br/>\nbest, not to say the only reasonable, mapping for the<br/>\nalternate #23, and thus ASCII uppercase {G} emerges as the<br/>\nbest mapping for #21 as discussed previously.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilar considerations apply to #15. From a practical point<br/>\nof view ASCII uppercase and lowercase {C}-{c} are equally<br/>\nsuitable for #15 once it is understood that #5 is ASCII {k}<br/>\nand #11 is ASCII {s}, but since any ASCII letter not mapped<br/>\nto a basic Quikscript letter will have to be mapped to a<br/>\nsound not normally associated with with the Traditional<br/>\nOrthography letter _c_ it is better to let the signal value<br/>\nof capitalization come into play with this other mapping,<br/>\nsince lowercase _c_ is at least part of the default<br/>\nTraditional Orthography spelling for #15.<br/>\n<br/>\n    List of mappings in BPJ 2.1<br/>\n<br/>\n(Again mappings with a following * differ from Jerome kmap,<br/>\nand the half-letters with an * after their name are not<br/>\nfound in the Quikscript Manual.)<br/>\n<br/>\n| QS # |(Jerome)| Name        | BPJ 2|<br/>\n|------|--------|-------------|------|<br/>\n| #1   | p      | Pea         | p    |<br/>\n| #2   | b      | Bay         | b    |<br/>\n| #3   | t      | Tea         | t    |<br/>\n| #4   | d      | Day         | d    |<br/>\n| #5   | k      | Key         | k    |<br/>\n| #6   | g      | Gay         | g    |<br/>\n| #7   | T      | Thaw        | T    |<br/>\n| #8   | H      | They        | D *  |<br/>\n| #9   | f      | Fee         | f    |<br/>\n| #10  | v      | Vie         | v    |<br/>\n| #11  | s      | See         | s    |<br/>\n| #12  | z      | Zoo         | z    |<br/>\n| #13  | S      | She         | S    |<br/>\n| #14  | Z      | J&#39;ai        | J *  |<br/>\n| #15  | c      | Cheer       | c    |<br/>\n| #16  | J      | Jay         | j *  |<br/>\n| #17  | j      | Ye          | y *  |<br/>\n| #18  | w      | Way         | w    |<br/>\n| #19  | h      | He          | h    |<br/>\n| #20  | `      | Why         | W *  |<br/>\n| #21  | N      | Ing         | G *  |<br/>\n| #22  | m      | May         | m    |<br/>\n| #23  | n      | No          | n    |<br/>\n| #24  | l      | Low         | l    |<br/>\n| #25  | r      | Roe         | r    |<br/>\n| #26  | i      | It          | i    |<br/>\n| #27  | I      | Eat         | I    |<br/>\n| #28  | e      | Et          | e    |<br/>\n| #29  | E      | Eight       | E    |<br/>\n| #30  | A      | At          | a *  |<br/>\n| #31  | F      | I           | Y *  |<br/>\n| #32  | y      | Ah          | A *  |<br/>\n| #33  | Y      | Awe         | Q *  |<br/>\n| #34  | o      | Ox          | o    |<br/>\n| #35  | q      | Oy          | q *  |<br/>\n| #36  | a      | Utter       | u *  |<br/>\n| #37  | Q      | Out         | B *  |<br/>\n| #38  | O      | Owe         | O    |<br/>\n| #39  | U      | Foot        | V *  |<br/>\n| #40  | M      | Ooze        | U *  |<br/>\n| #41  | \u00e7      | Loch        | K *  |<br/>\n| #42  | \u00e6      | Llan        | L *  |<br/>\n| #43  | \u00e8      | Excite      | x *  |<br/>\n| #44  | \u00e9      | Exam        | X *  |<br/>\n| #23.2| G      | Noon        | N *  |<br/>\n| #36.2| u      | Up          | C *  |<br/>\n| -    | /      | naming dot  | ` *  |<br/>\n| -    |        | left bracket| (    |<br/>\n| -    |        |right bracket| )    |<br/>\n| #1.5 | ]      | half-Pea    | P *  |<br/>\n| #3.5 | [      | half-Tea    | F *  |<br/>\n| #4.5 | B      | half-Day    | R *  |<br/>\n| #12.5| L      | half-Zoo    | Z *  |<br/>\n| #17.5| ^      | half-Ye *   | ^    |<br/>\n| #18.5| @      | half-Way    | M *  |<br/>\n| #19.5| &#92;&#92; (&#92;&#92;)| half-He     | H *  |<br/>\n| #20.5| ~      | half-Why *  | ~    |<br/>\n<br/>\n   Footnotes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[^3]: Originally _V\u2014u_ constituted an upper-lowercase pair.<br/>\n     The split into two letters was invented in the 16th century<br/>\n     and completed in the 18th.<br/>\n<br/>\n        See &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U</a>&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n[^4]: actual, actuary, actuate, architecture, beachcomber,<br/>\n     beechcraft, chukchi, conjecture, contractual, effectuate,<br/>\n     factual, fluctuate, fracture, hutchcraft, inchcape,<br/>\n     ineffectual, infrastructure, intellectual, juncture,<br/>\n     latchkey, lecture, manufacture, picture, prefecture,<br/>\n     punctuate, puncture, sanctuary, stricture, structure,<br/>\n     tincture, witchcraft.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Source: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict\">http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n        See <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMU_Pronouncing_Dictionary\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMU_Pronouncing_Dictionary</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n19.12.2007 Benct Philip Jonsson &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bpj@...\">bpj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n}</div>",

People may find it\nattractive in spite of the fact that it will constitute a\ncompromise between an ASCII transliteration *of\nQuikscript* and yet another quasi-phonemic ASCII\ntranscription of English.\n\n    mappings which differ between BPJ 1 and BPJ 2.1\n\n| QS # |(Jerome)| Name        | BPJ 1| BPJ 2.1     |\n|------|--------|-------------|------|-------------|\n| #14  | Z      | J&#39;ai        | Z    | J *         |\n| #16  | J      | Jay         | J    | j *         |\n| #17  | j      | Ye          | j    | y *         |\n| #31  | F      | I           | A *  | Y *         |\n| #32  | y      | Ah          | q *  | A *         |\n| #35  | q      | Oy          | O *  | q           |\n| #36  | a      | Utter       | y *  | u *         |\n| #37  | Q      | Out         | Y *  | B *         |\n| #39  | U      | Foot        | u *  | V *         |\n| #38  | O      | Owe         | B *  | O           |\n| #36.2| u      | Up          | V *  | C *         |\n| #12.5| L      | half-Zoo    | C *  | Z *         |\n\n    Quikscript-ASCII as a transliteration\n\nAny mapping of Quikscript letters to ASCII letters will in\neffect be a transliteration, and as such it must be easy\nto read even if displayed in a normal ASCII font rather\nthan a Quikscript font, because there will be times, more\nor less frequent, when we will be reading transcribed text\nwithout having the time or opportunity to view it in a\nQuikscript font.\n\n    The signalling function of capitalization\n\nThe more I think of it the more convinced I get that in an\nASCII mapping of Quikscript the ASCII lowercase letters\nshould as far as possible be mapped to their regular\nTraditional Orthography sounds - say their sounds as they\nwould say when teaching spelling in school - while the ASCII\nuppercase letters should be used to signal their own\notherness.\n\n    Other vowel mappings\n\n     The lowercase ASCII vowel letters\n\nFor that reason the five lowercase vowel letters _i, e, a,\no, u_ should be mapped to #26, #28, #30, #34, #36, _j_ and\n_y_ to #16 and #17 and so on for all the Traditional\nOrthography single letters which have a default phoneme\ncorrespondence.\n\n     The ASCII uppercase vowel letters\n\nOnce the system of marking Quikscript paired vowels with\ncapitalization has been abandoned by the remapping of {u}\nand {y} there is no point in keeping ASCII {A, O, Y} for\n#31, #35, #37; indeed these mappings become more misleading\nthan the old uppercase {F} for #31, since people will expect\nthem to be mapped to vowels, but these sounds are never\nwritten with these Traditional Orthography letters, unlike\n_I_ and _E_ which at least map to the sounds of #27 and #29\nin recent french loans like _machine_ and _ballet_. It\nbecomes better to use uppercase {Y} for #31, since this\nletter and sound are associated in Traditional Orthography\n(_my, rye, edify, hyphen_). It is also obviously better to\nmap ASCII uppercase {A} to #32, since this sound is always\nwritten _a_ in accents like RP which maintain the three-way\ncontrast between #32, #33, #34. In the same vein ASCII\nuppercase {O} can be conveniently mapped to #38, which is\n&#39;the long sound of _o_&#39; in Traditional Orthography. For #33\nwe will map uppercase {Q} also in this mapping, if onlu\nbecause we will need to map _Q_ to some Quikscript letter,\nand at least uppercase {Q} looks like uppercase {O} with a\nsquiggle, just like #33 looks like #34 with a squiggle!\n\n     Quikscript vowel letters mapped to ASCII consonant\n     letters.\n\nThis will leave ASCII {q} as the odd man out among the ASCII\nlowercase letters; I have mapped it to #35, not only because\nit is the old mapping, but also because lowercase _q_ does\nhave some similarity, to the Quikscript letter itself \u2014 a\nloop with a downwards tail to the right \u2014 as well as to the\nTraditional Orthography digraph _oy_.\n\nWith lowercase {u} mapped to #36 some other ASCII letter\nmust be found for #39, and after some consideration I have\ncome to the conclusion that uppercase {V}, as proposed by\nTed Larson freeman, is indeed the best choice: it looks\nsimilar to the Quikscript letter, and historically the\nTraditional Orthography letters _U_ and _V_[^3] were variant\nforms of the same letter.\n\nASCII uppercase {B} will still be mapped to a vowel, and\nnow memory-cued to the word &quot;bout&quot;, and probably those who\nare familiar with the _&#x0223;_ ligature form of the _ou_\ndigraph will be aided by its visual similarity to\nuppercase _B_.\n\nI choose to map ASCII uppercase {C} to alternate #36, since\nTed Larson Freeman brought the graphic similarity between\nthese letters of the two alphabets to attention, and with\n{V} mapped to #39 no other of the available uppercase letter\nfits better. That uppercase {C} is more readable than\nlowercase in this role, especially next to {k}, because\ncapitalization serves to signal that C does not have any of\nthe usual sound values of Traditional Orthography c, nor,\nindeed, marks a vowel is easily seen by comparing {skClpcur,\nakCmpliS, surkCs, kClcurCl, kCstCm} (or {kCsFCm}) with\n{skclpCur, akcmpliS, surkcs, kclCurcl, kcstcm} (or {kcsFcm})\nfor _sculpture, accomplish, circus, cultural, custom_. There\nare, not counting derivations, some 30 words where #5 and\n#15 occur next to each other[^4], but I deem these to be of\nfar less text frequency than in particular the combinations\n#36+#24 and #36+#22, espescially if one considers that\nseveral of these words have alternative pronunciations with\n#3+#17 instead of #15, and thus should perhaps be spelled\naccordingly.\n\n    Consonant mappings\n\nThe remaining Quikscript letters must and should be mapped\nto uppercase ASCII letters. The Traditional Orthography\nequivalents of these Quikscript letters will normally be\ndigraphs, and as a general principle the uppercase ASCII\ncharacter choosen to represent them should correspond to\none of the letters of these digraph. There will, even must,\nbe deviations from this principle, but these should be well\ngrounded and provided with good memory-cues. As it turns\nout only _T, S, W_ for #7, #13, #20 will more or less\nunproblematically follow this principle. Analogy then\nsuggests that _D, C, Z, N_ be mapped to #8, #14, #15, #21,\nbut again it turns out that only {D} #8 will stand\nrelatively unaffected by other considerations. Traditional\nOrthography never writes the sound of #8 with a spelling\ncontaining the letter _d_, but the analogy to _T_ for #7 is\nrelatively flawless here. Not so with the sound of #14:\nspellings with _z_ corresponding to this sound are\nvirtually confined to the use of _zh_ in transcribed\nRussian names. The Traditional Orthography consonant letter\nmost regularly associated with this sound is actually _s_,\nbut there is another Traditional Orthography letter which\nis fairly regularly associated with the sound, namely _j_\nin recent French loan words. This suggests uppercase {J} as\nthe best mapping for #14, as does the fact that words like\ngarage and mirage have variant pronunciations with #16.\nThere is also the fact to consider that uppercase ASCII\nletters which don&#39;t get mapped to basic or alternate\nletters will almost inevitably end up mapped to half-\nletters, whether we include those in our &#39;official&#39;\nproposals or not, and it seems much better to map the ASCII\nuppercase {Z} to the frequently used half-z and ASCII\nuppercase {J} to #14 than the other way around!\n\nWith #21 the problem is somewhat different. What causes\nproblems here is that ASCII uppercase {N} is clearly the\nbest, not to say the only reasonable, mapping for the\nalternate #23, and thus ASCII uppercase {G} emerges as the\nbest mapping for #21 as discussed previously.\n\nSimilar considerations apply to #15. From a practical point\nof view ASCII uppercase and lowercase {C}-{c} are equally\nsuitable for #15 once it is understood that #5 is ASCII {k}\nand #11 is ASCII {s}, but since any ASCII letter not mapped\nto a basic Quikscript letter will have to be mapped to a\nsound not normally associated with with the Traditional\nOrthography letter _c_ it is better to let the signal value\nof capitalization come into play with this other mapping,\nsince lowercase _c_ is at least part of the default\nTraditional Orthography spelling for #15.\n\n    List of mappings in BPJ 2.1\n\n(Again mappings with a following * differ from Jerome kmap,\nand the half-letters with an * after their name are not\nfound in the Quikscript Manual.)\n\n| QS # |(Jerome)| Name        | BPJ 2|\n|------|--------|-------------|------|\n| #1   | p      | Pea         | p    |\n| #2   | b      | Bay         | b    |\n| #3   | t      | Tea         | t    |\n| #4   | d      | Day         | d    |\n| #5   | k      | Key         | k    |\n| #6   | g      | Gay         | g    |\n| #7   | T      | Thaw        | T    |\n| #8   | H      | They        | D *  |\n| #9   | f      | Fee         | f    |\n| #10  | v      | Vie         | v    |\n| #11  | s      | See         | s    |\n| #12  | z      | Zoo         | z    |\n| #13  | S      | She         | S    |\n| #14  | Z      | J&#39;ai        | J *  |\n| #15  | c      | Cheer       | c    |\n| #16  | J      | Jay         | j *  |\n| #17  | j      | Ye          | y *  |\n| #18  | w      | Way         | w    |\n| #19  | h      | He          | h    |\n| #20  | `      | Why         | W *  |\n| #21  | N      | Ing         | G *  |\n| #22  | m      | May         | m    |\n| #23  | n      | No          | n    |\n| #24  | l      | Low         | l    |\n| #25  | r      | Roe         | r    |\n| #26  | i      | It          | i    |\n| #27  | I      | Eat         | I    |\n| #28  | e      | Et          | e    |\n| #29  | E      | Eight       | E    |\n| #30  | A      | At          | a *  |\n| #31  | F      | I           | Y *  |\n| #32  | y      | Ah          | A *  |\n| #33  | Y      | Awe         | Q *  |\n| #34  | o      | Ox          | o    |\n| #35  | q      | Oy          | q *  |\n| #36  | a      | Utter       | u *  |\n| #37  | Q      | Out         | B *  |\n| #38  | O      | Owe         | O    |\n| #39  | U      | Foot        | V *  |\n| #40  | M      | Ooze        | U *  |\n| #41  | \u00e7      | Loch        | K *  |\n| #42  | \u00e6      | Llan        | L *  |\n| #43  | \u00e8      | Excite      | x *  |\n| #44  | \u00e9      | Exam        | X *  |\n| #23.2| G      | Noon        | N *  |\n| #36.2| u      | Up          | C *  |\n| -    | /      | naming dot  | ` *  |\n| -    |        | left bracket| (    |\n| -    |        |right bracket| )    |\n| #1.5 | ]      | half-Pea    | P *  |\n| #3.5 | [      | half-Tea    | F *  |\n| #4.5 | B      | half-Day    | R *  |\n| #12.5| L      | half-Zoo    | Z *  |\n| #17.5| ^      | half-Ye *   | ^    |\n| #18.5| @      | half-Way    | M *  |\n| #19.5| &#92;&#92; (&#92;&#92;)| half-He     | H *  |\n| #20.5| ~      | half-Why *  | ~    |\n\n   Footnotes\n\n\n[^3]: Originally _V\u2014u_ constituted an upper-lowercase pair.\n     The split into two letters was invented in the 16th century\n     and completed in the 18th.\n\n        See &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U&gt;.\n\n[^4]: actual, actuary, actuate, architecture, beachcomber,\n     beechcraft, chukchi, conjecture, contractual, effectuate,\n     factual, fluctuate, fracture, hutchcraft, inchcape,\n     ineffectual, infrastructure, intellectual, juncture,\n     latchkey, lecture, manufacture, picture, prefecture,\n     punctuate, puncture, sanctuary, stricture, structure,\n     tincture, witchcraft.\n\n        Source: &lt;http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict&gt;\n\n        See \n&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMU_Pronouncing_Dictionary&gt;\n\n\n19.12.2007 Benct Philip Jonsson &lt;mailto:bpj@...&gt;\n}\n\n"
