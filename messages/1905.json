For the last two, I initially just<br/>\nused x and X as you have them here. But then in your discussion, you<br/>\nsay this:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Excite &lt;-&gt; X :<br/>\nReason: same as half of other proposals.

The primary one to<br/>\n&gt;  use is &#39;Q&#39; but use &#39;\u00f6&#39; when wishing to improve english font<br/>\n&gt;  readability.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  # Differences between this and my previous mapping :<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  --- Differences between letters previously assigned ---<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - why &lt;-&gt; P : instead of W :<br/>\n&gt;  Reason : To accomodate the new &#39;out&#39; phoneme mapping below. Since<br/>\n&gt;  the &#39;why&#39; phoneme is not used by most people it shouldn&#39;t bother<br/>\n&gt;  most that it is mapped to a very illogical key.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - out &lt;-&gt; W : instead of H :<br/>\n&gt;  Reason: Forms part of the TO letter combination &#39;OW&#39;- if map &#39;\u00d3&#39;<br/>\n&gt;  to &#39;null&#39; then can use &#39;\u00d3W&#39; for this phoneme when writing to<br/>\n&gt;  maximise english font readability. (eg: _how_ -&gt; h\u00d3W).

Chose this even though &#39;excite&#39; is more frequent in use<br/>\n&gt;  than &#39;exam&#39;. In this case both letters are so infrequent that the<br/>\n&gt;  possible shift key stroke saving would hardly amount to anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - Exam &lt;-&gt; x :<br/>\n&gt;  Reason: same as half of other proposals, see &#39;excite&#39; above.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - Noon &lt;-&gt; M :<br/>\n&gt;  Reason: same as some of the other proposals, have run out of logical<br/>\n&gt;  assignments.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - Up &lt;-&gt; G :<br/>\n&gt;  Reason: arbitrary mapping, have run out of logical assignemts<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - naming dot &lt;-&gt; ` :<br/>\n&gt;  Reason: same as other proposals.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - left bracket &lt;-&gt; ( :<br/>\n&gt;  Reason: same as other proposals.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - right bracket &lt;-&gt; ) :<br/>\n&gt;  Reason: same as other proposals.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - more utter mappings &#39;\u00e0 \u00e8 \u00ec \u00f2&#39; :<br/>\n&gt;  Reason : to improve english font readability as required. eg: use<br/>\n&gt;  one of these to replace a TO vowel glyph that makes a shwa (/@/)<br/>\n&gt;  sound in a word (using an australian accent)- _abet_ -&gt; \u00e0bet ,<br/>\n&gt;  _begin_ -&gt; b\u00e8giN , _rigid_ -&gt; rij\u00ecd , _occur_ -&gt; \u00f2kur<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - more null mappings &#39;\u00c1 \u00c9 \u00cd \u00d3 \u00da \u00dd&#39; :<br/>\n&gt;  Reason to improve english font readability as required. eg: combine<br/>\n&gt;  the acute marked null characters with the mapped capital letter<br/>\n&gt;  vowels/diphthongs- _see_ -&gt; sE\u00c9 , _seat_ -&gt; sE\u00c1t , _here_ -&gt; hEr\u00c9 ,<br/>\n&gt;  _main_ -&gt; mA\u00cdn , _day_ -&gt; dA\u00dd , _mate_ -&gt; mAt\u00c9 , kite -&gt; kIt\u00c9 ,<br/>\n&gt;  _boat_ -&gt; bO\u00c1t , _note_ -&gt; nOt\u00c9 , _lute_ -&gt; lUt\u00c9 , _cow_ -&gt; c\u00d3W ,<br/>\n&gt;  _boy_ -&gt; b\u00d3Y<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  # A memory guide/summary of explanation of mapping :<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  -all lower case consonant keys that are used in the mapping say the<br/>\n&gt;  usual sound that everyday people are familiar with<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  already. eg: &#39;b&#39; maps to &#39;bay&#39;, &#39;j&#39; to &#39;jay&#39;, &#39;y&#39; to &#39;ye&#39;, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  -a mapped upper case consonant key indicates that it does not say<br/>\n&gt;  the usual sound. The upper case constant mappings are<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  similar to other key mapping proposals.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  -all lower case vowel keys say the usual short vowel sounds: ie: &#39;a<br/>\n&gt;  e i o u&#39; map to the vowel sounds in the words _bat_, _bet_, _bit_,<br/>\n&gt;  _bot_ (british english accent - not merged american) and _but_<br/>\n&gt;  respectively.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  -all upper case vowels say their own name: ie: &#39;A E I O U&#39; map to<br/>\n&gt;  the vowel sounds in the words _say_, _see_, _sigh_, _sew_, _sue_<br/>\n&gt;  (well &#39;U&#39; sort of says its name)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  -upper case &#39;R&#39; says its own name. ie: &#39;R&#39; maps to the vowel sound<br/>\n&gt;  in _car_<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  -upper case &#39;W&#39; and &#39;Y&#39; map to the vowel sounds in the words _cow_<br/>\n&gt;  and _coy_<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  -upper case &#39;Q&#39; maps to the vowel sound in the word _core_. (&#39;Q&#39;<br/>\n&gt;  sort of looks like an &#39;o&#39;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  -upper case &#39;V&#39; maps to the vowel sound in the word _cook_. (just<br/>\n&gt;  have to learn this one)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  # Comments on this revision :<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - the mapping is now logically split between lower and upper case.<br/>\n&gt;  All lower case sound/key mappings are commonly experienced in<br/>\n&gt;  everyday english. Whereas upper case sound/key combinations may not<br/>\n&gt;  be common nor feel as logical.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - there are now two lower case keys that are not mapped, &#39;c&#39;<br/>\n&gt;  and &#39;q&#39;. These keys could be used in a quikscripters personal<br/>\n&gt;  keyboard mapping as an alternative to two of the mapped upper case<br/>\n&gt;  keys. Doing this eliminates some shift key presses.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - the lower case keys map to the most of the most frequently used<br/>\n&gt;  letters. Approximately 85% of text only requires lower case key<br/>\n&gt;  strokes (according to the quikscript letter frequency chart in the<br/>\n&gt;  files/resources folder). If you personally map &#39;c&#39; and &#39;q&#39; to<br/>\n&gt;  the &#39;eight&#39; and &#39;they&#39; letters then this increases to approx 90%,<br/>\n&gt;  ie: only 10% of letters typed in normal text require a shift key<br/>\n&gt;  press.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - there are now more &#39;null&#39; and &#39;utter&#39; mappings compared to the<br/>\n&gt;  original proposal. Although these extra mappings can be used to<br/>\n&gt;  further improve english font readability, I feel that the principle<br/>\n&gt;  that a mapping should minimise null and multiple mappings has much<br/>\n&gt;  merit. I&#39;m very open to dicussion about the reducing the number of<br/>\n&gt;  these extra mappings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  # Reasons for me wanting to increase english font readability:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - 1. For use when writing for the general public and not<br/>\n&gt;  specifically for quikscripters. This offers a way to improve<br/>\n&gt;  quikscript awareness. Eg: a web page that is written in quikscript<br/>\n&gt;  will still be readable (with effort) by non-quikscripters, ideally<br/>\n&gt;  such a web page would provide a link to explain why the writing is<br/>\n&gt;  strange and offer a chance for the readers to learn more about<br/>\n&gt;  quikscript. (This is my personal primary motivation as it is a<br/>\n&gt;  situation that I&#39;m currently facing with one of my websites that is<br/>\n&gt;  written in quikscript. The website is about a free GPL&#39;ed booking<br/>\n&gt;  keeping program that I&#39;m coding. I&#39;m thinking about writing all the<br/>\n&gt;  dialog and help messages within the program in quikscript as well.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - 2. Even if users are not interested in learning QS per se, by<br/>\n&gt;  having them read text which is basically a phonemic mapping<br/>\n&gt;  increases their phonemic awareness and lighlights the obsurdity that<br/>\n&gt;  traditional english spelling has degenerated to. Realising the<br/>\n&gt;  obsurdity of TO is half the battle of spelling reform. (I<br/>\n&gt;  personally found that learning the QS alphabet itself to be very<br/>\n&gt;  easy. The real challenge I had of writing QS lies in being able to<br/>\n&gt;  phonemically sound out words. Many times I would write a word how I<br/>\n&gt;  thought it sounded only to find that the dictionary pronounced it<br/>\n&gt;  different. At first I would think that the dictionary was wrong,<br/>\n&gt;  until I listened very carefully to how the word was normally<br/>\n&gt;  pronounced. A major cause of this error was that the traditional<br/>\n&gt;  spellings were negatively biasing how I perceived the sounds of<br/>\n&gt;  words.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - 3. People new to QS can use the english font readability to ease<br/>\n&gt;  themselves into QS. By first reading text (such as the QS-news<br/>\n&gt;  feeds) in an english font they can increase their phonemic<br/>\n&gt;  awareness. Then they can gradually introduce new QS letters every<br/>\n&gt;  few days by using find/replace to replace the english font with a QS<br/>\n&gt;  font for each new letter. (Of course, instead of doing this font<br/>\n&gt;  replacement manually, some super-techie quickscripter would be able<br/>\n&gt;  to write a small program that downloads the news-feed and does this<br/>\n&gt;  automatically for them :) ). This would result in a progressive<br/>\n&gt;  tutorial approach like my Alice-in-Wonderland tutes, except they<br/>\n&gt;  explicitly control how fast and in which order they progress to each<br/>\n&gt;  new letter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Merry Christmas All<br/>\n&gt;  Peter<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",

The upper case constant mappi=\r\nngs are\n&gt;\n&gt;  similar to other key mapping proposals.\n&gt;\n&gt;  -all lower case v=\r\nowel keys say the usual short vowel sounds: ie: &#39;a\n&gt;  e i o u&#39; map to the v=\r\nowel sounds in the words _bat_, _bet_, _bit_,\n&gt;  _bot_ (british english acc=\r\nent - not merged american) and _but_\n&gt;  respectively.\n&gt;\n&gt;  -all upper case =\r\nvowels say their own name: ie: &#39;A E I O U&#39; map to\n&gt;  the vowel sounds in th=\r\ne words _say_, _see_, _sigh_, _sew_, _sue_\n&gt;  (well &#39;U&#39; sort of says its na=\r\nme)\n&gt;\n&gt;  -upper case &#39;R&#39; says its own name. ie: &#39;R&#39; maps to the vowel sound=\r\n\n&gt;  in _car_\n&gt;\n&gt;  -upper case &#39;W&#39; and &#39;Y&#39; map to the vowel sounds in the wo=\r\nrds _cow_\n&gt;  and _coy_\n&gt;\n&gt;  -upper case &#39;Q&#39; maps to the vowel sound in the =\r\nword _core_. (&#39;Q&#39;\n&gt;  sort of looks like an &#39;o&#39;)\n&gt;\n&gt;  -upper case &#39;V&#39; maps t=\r\no the vowel sound in the word _cook_. (just\n&gt;  have to learn this one)\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n # Comments on this revision :\n&gt;\n&gt;  - the mapping is now logically split be=\r\ntween lower and upper case.\n&gt;  All lower case sound/key mappings are common=\r\nly experienced in\n&gt;  everyday english. Whereas upper case sound/key combina=\r\ntions may not\n&gt;  be common nor feel as logical.\n&gt;\n&gt;  - there are now two lo=\r\nwer case keys that are not mapped, &#39;c&#39;\n&gt;  and &#39;q&#39;. These keys could be used=\r\n in a quikscripters personal\n&gt;  keyboard mapping as an alternative to two o=\r\nf the mapped upper case\n&gt;  keys. Doing this eliminates some shift key press=\r\nes.\n&gt;\n&gt;  - the lower case keys map to the most of the most frequently used\n=\r\n&gt;  letters. Approximately 85% of text only requires lower case key\n&gt;  strok=\r\nes (according to the quikscript letter frequency chart in the\n&gt;  files/reso=\r\nurces folder). If you personally map &#39;c&#39; and &#39;q&#39; to\n&gt;  the &#39;eight&#39; and &#39;the=\r\ny&#39; letters then this increases to approx 90%,\n&gt;  ie: only 10% of letters ty=\r\nped in normal text require a shift key\n&gt;  press.\n&gt;\n&gt;  - there are now more =\r\n&#39;null&#39; and &#39;utter&#39; mappings compared to the\n&gt;  original proposal. Although =\r\nthese extra mappings can be used to\n&gt;  further improve english font readabi=\r\nlity, I feel that the principle\n&gt;  that a mapping should minimise null and =\r\nmultiple mappings has much\n&gt;  merit. I&#39;m very open to dicussion about the r=\r\neducing the number of\n&gt;  these extra mappings.\n&gt;\n&gt;  # Reasons for me wantin=\r\ng to increase english font readability:\n&gt;\n&gt;  - 1. For use when writing for =\r\nthe general public and not\n&gt;  specifically for quikscripters. This offers a=\r\n way to improve\n&gt;  quikscript awareness. Eg: a web page that is written in =\r\nquikscript\n&gt;  will still be readable (with effort) by non-quikscripters, id=\r\neally\n&gt;  such a web page would provide a link to explain why the writing is=\r\n\n&gt;  strange and offer a chance for the readers to learn more about\n&gt;  quiks=\r\ncript. (This is my personal primary motivation as it is a\n&gt;  situation that=\r\n I&#39;m currently facing with one of my websites that is\n&gt;  written in quikscr=\r\nipt. The website is about a free GPL&#39;ed booking\n&gt;  keeping program that I&#39;m=\r\n coding. I&#39;m thinking about writing all the\n&gt;  dialog and help messages wit=\r\nhin the program in quikscript as well.)\n&gt;\n&gt;  - 2. Even if users are not int=\r\nerested in learning QS per se, by\n&gt;  having them read text which is basical=\r\nly a phonemic mapping\n&gt;  increases their phonemic awareness and lighlights =\r\nthe obsurdity that\n&gt;  traditional english spelling has degenerated to. Real=\r\nising the\n&gt;  obsurdity of TO is half the battle of spelling reform. (I\n&gt;  p=\r\nersonally found that learning the QS alphabet itself to be very\n&gt;  easy. Th=\r\ne real challenge I had of writing QS lies in being able to\n&gt;  phonemically =\r\nsound out words. Many times I would write a word how I\n&gt;  thought it sounde=\r\nd only to find that the dictionary pronounced it\n&gt;  different. At first I w=\r\nould think that the dictionary was wrong,\n&gt;  until I listened very carefull=\r\ny to how the word was normally\n&gt;  pronounced. A major cause of this error w=\r\nas that the traditional\n&gt;  spellings were negatively biasing how I perceive=\r\nd the sounds of\n&gt;  words.)\n&gt;\n&gt;  - 3. People new to QS can use the english f=\r\nont readability to ease\n&gt;  themselves into QS. By first reading text (such =\r\nas the QS-news\n&gt;  feeds) in an english font they can increase their phonemi=\r\nc\n&gt;  awareness. Then they can gradually introduce new QS letters every\n&gt;  f=\r\new days by using find/replace to replace the english font with a QS\n&gt;  font=\r\n for each new letter. (Of course, instead of doing this font\n&gt;  replacement=\r\n manually, some super-techie quickscripter would be able\n&gt;  to write a smal=\r\nl program that downloads the news-feed and does this\n&gt;  automatically for t=\r\nhem :) ). This would result in a progressive\n&gt;  tutorial approach like my A=\r\nlice-in-Wonderland tutes, except they\n&gt;  explicitly control how fast and in=\r\n which order they progress to each\n&gt;  new letter.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Merry Christmas All\n=\r\n&gt;  Peter\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n"
