For no readily apparent reason, I&#39;ve become attached to Quikscript and have found it to be an excellent way to kill conversations at lunch with coworkers.  Thus I find myself in this corner of the internet hoping to learn more.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short intervals, I&#39;ve put in a few months learning.  I&#39;m still getting up to speed on my reading and putting in the heavy lifting of learning vowels, but can do many of the basics automatically.  Evidently, it is an advantage having a simple midwestern accent which obviates the need for some vowels or the troublesome #20.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my searching, I have come up with some recurring themes that perhaps someone might venture to answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is the Quikscript alphabet called the Read Alphabet here (including the group&#39;s name)?  I cannot find any real reference to how this came about.  My only guess is that someone with a cruel sense of humor wanted others to google &quot;read alphabet&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\nI get that Kingsley Read created it and that someone is probably trying to honor him, but he called it Quikscript in his original manual so one would think that would be enough.  Bringing up the manual reminds me that Mr. Read spelled quikscript as quickscript as well.  Which leads to more confusion on what to search for.  Fortunately, Wikipedia redirects people to a single page.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere did the term Second Shaw come in?  Mysteriously, it is featured prominently in Wikipedia, but that is the pretty much last time you will find reference to it.  I&#39;ve read the history of the Shaw Alphabet, but cannot guess why there is yet another name for QS.<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting about Wikipedia reminds me, does anyone else find it puzzling that next to the detailed description about 40 letters there is a graphic (originating from Mr. Tremblay, I believe) showing 50 symbols.  It takes some digging to discover that the extra symbols are ligatures and the Scottish additions to the alphabet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any response, I&#39;m off to read Cthulhu (pdf version).<br/>\n<br/>\nJayson</div>",
