Instead of mad orthodox scribbling, the calligraphic \nqualities of QS help me to relax, think about what I&#39;m doing, and \nenjoy the process of putting ideas to paper. Speed will come someday, \nI hope, but meanwhile patience is a great teacher.  Days later, when \nI am transcribing the QS into orthodox on the computer, I get my most \nvaluable QS experience -   reading your own writing.\n\nSecond, in my job I am always interviewing potential clients.  I used \nto make little notes to myself on their applications, just to help me \nremember them days or weeks later.  These were usually embarrassing \ncomments, actually, but the more embarassing they were, the easier it \nwas to remember them. So now I can write &lt;bAYB az a biljRB bYl&gt; or \n&lt;simplI tM mac mEkap!&gt; without fear of the client or anyone else \nknowing what I wrote.\n\nIf you&#39;ve ever tried calligraphy, you will now that it&#39;s harder to \nlearn how to change the way you write an &quot;a&quot; for example, than it is \nto learn for the first time, as a thinking adult, how to make a &quot;A&quot; \nand then make it connect to a &quot;Y&quot; or a &quot;n&quot;\n\nJust for practice, I also do my grocery list in QS.\n\n\n&gt;2) Is there a dictionary of any sort for spellings in the Read\n&gt;Alphabet?  How do you know if you&#39;re spelling words right?  I&#39;ve\n&gt;noticed some misspellings in posts, and I wonder about that.\n\nYou hit a sore point here in the QS community, and  even more so in \nthe Shavian community, which seems more hung up on &quot;correctness&quot; than \nwe are at the Read site.\n\nTo write an &quot;orthodox&quot; dictionary, somebody looked at how the \nmajority of educated people spelled a word (&quot;the Authorities&quot;) and \nthen they also recorded how it sounded in fancy and mind-boggling \nnotation, which varied from dictionary to dictionary.  A QS \ndictionary, on the other hand, has only to decide how &quot;Authorities&quot; \npronounce  words, and transcribe the words accordingly.  (Think of My \nFair Lady, and Rex Harrison copying down the patois of the Cockneys.) \nSo the question remains, &quot;Which authoritative accent will the QS \ndictionary accept?&quot;  The Read community has wisely been been loath to \ntry to set up any accent as more acceptable than another.\n\nAll this being said, I have been keeping my own dictionary for over a \nyear now, and it is a great way to double check myself, and to bring \nconsistency at least within my own practice.  I have recently begun \ntranscribing the Preface to Androcles and the Lion (the play having \nalready been accomplished by better ears than mine.)  After the first \n4500 words, (alas, only 20% of the whole) I put the text into a \ndatabase file to discover how many different spellings I had used for \nthe same English word.  It was frightening how all-over-the-place my \nspelling was.\n\nBefore proceeding with the work, I have stopped to reconcile all \nthese different spellings - quite a project in itself. So what I am \nbuilding is a dictionary of how I write - nothing authoritative, but, \nin its own way, at least consistent within itself.\n\nYet I realize that the only fruits of all these labors will be a \nrecord of how a middle-aged American, born in  Alabama, raised in \nMissouri, and trying to affect an East Coast accent, would sound.\n\n&gt;Also,\n&gt;what about punctuation?  Wouldn&#39;t one think that punctuation that\n&gt;would connect to the letters would fit better, as well as numbers\nthat connect?\n\nI don&#39;t see that as much of a saving.  Most Shavians, in honor of \nShaw, I suppose, already eliminate apostrophes all together. What&#39;s \nleft?  Quotes are now one mark (&lt;) rather than two (&quot;).  That&#39;s \nnice. What could be more efficient than &quot;.&quot;?  How many times do we \nuse question marks anyway?\n\nAs for numerals, you would just be throwing out a perfect shorthand \nto install another one.  The whole point of QS or Shavian, is a \none-to-one correspondence between sound and symbol.  What could be \nmore efficient than 12345 etc?  Just be thankful we aren&#39;t using \nRoman numerals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Please reply this time, thank you.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!

So what I am\nbuilding is a dictionary of how I write - nothing authoritative, but,\nin its own way, at least consistent within itself.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Yet I realize that the only fruits of all these labors will be a\nrecord of how a middle-aged American, born in&nbsp; Alabama, raised\nin Missouri, and trying to affect an East Coast accent, would\nsound.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;blockquote type=&quot;cite&quot; cite&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Also,&lt;br&gt;\nwhat about punctuation?&nbsp; Wouldn&#39;t one think that punctuation\nthat&lt;br&gt;\nwould connect to the letters would fit better, as well as\nnumbers&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;tt&gt;that connect?&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I don&#39;t see that as much of a saving.&nbsp; Most Shavians, in\nhonor of Shaw, I suppose, already eliminate apostrophes all together.\nWhat&#39;s left?&nbsp; Quotes are now one mark (&lt;font\nface=&quot;jerome&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;/font&gt;) rather than two (&quot;).&nbsp;\nThat&#39;s&nbsp; nice. What could be more efficient than\n&quot;.&quot;?&nbsp; How many times do we use question marks\nanyway?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;As for numerals, you would just be throwing out a perfect\nshorthand to install another one.&nbsp; The whole point of QS or\nShavian, is a one-to-one correspondence between sound and\nsymbol.&nbsp; What could be more efficient than 12345 etc?&nbsp; Just\nbe thankful we aren&#39;t using Roman numerals.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;blockquote type=&quot;cite&quot; cite&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Please reply this time, thank\nyou.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot; color=&quot;#003399&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yahoo!
