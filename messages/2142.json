It&#39;s tempting to think three vowels, three letters, but if Ah is father and Awe is thaw, then thought would have to be ox, and that&#39;s just not right, because thought is a diphthong, and ox isn&#39;t meant to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I have on my hands an ox-ah merger, then an awe split, but I had to write this post to work that out, so I may as well post it anyways and then ask, does anyone have any insight?</div>",
