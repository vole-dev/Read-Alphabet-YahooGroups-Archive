  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-856941523\"><div>Dear Paige et al</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>May I heartily agree with you. Having been one of the very early users of QS in corresondence with Kingsley Read and two other English speakers with considerably different accents to mine or his, not only did I have no difficulty in understanding these people, but I also received a good impression of the local accents (one of our group being from Ulster) - and surely this is the beauty of QS?\n</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>I am a firm believer of using the abbreviations as laid out by Read - and I use these myself extensively when writing in QS.&nbsp; While a child would have to &quot;learn&quot; these abbreviations, they are all that would have to be learned - the rest of the English language would be entirely logical to the young ear.\n</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Moira<br><br>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-856941523gmail_quote\">On 10/09/2007, <b class=\"ygrps-yiv-856941523gmail_sendername\">pgabhart</b> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pgabhart@...\">pgabhart@...</a>&gt; wrote:</span>\n<blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-856941523gmail_quote\" style=\"PADDING-LEFT:1ex;MARGIN:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;BORDER-LEFT:#ccc 1px solid;\">\n<div style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ffffff;\">\n<div style=\"WIDTH:655px;\">\n<div style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:15px;PADDING-LEFT:0px;FLOAT:left;PADDING-BOTTOM:0px;WIDTH:490px;PADDING-TOP:0px;\">\n<div>\n<p>First, I disagree with the statement &quot;QS is meant to be heard.&quot; Not <br>meaning to be categorical, but QS is an attempt to realign English with <br>an alphabet that works the way an alphabet is supposed to: one sound = \n<br>one phoneme. The QS manual starts off with the reasons why trying to <br>redesign the Roman alphabet just doesn&#39;t cut it. A new alphabet was needed.<br><br>The problem I see with standardized spelling is that the \n<br>&quot;English-speaking Peoples&quot; have no language academy to even attempt to <br>enforce spelling changes as the language continues to evolve. That is <br>sort of how we got in this mess (TO) to begin with. <br><br>\nI may be abysmally ignorant of the extent of English dialects, but I <br>suspect that for a very large majority of English speakers, i.e. the <br>ones clustered in the middle of the bell curve of English pronunciation, <br>\nwe could get along just fine without a standardized spelling because the <br>majority of the words we use on a daily basis are not going to be spelt <br>so peculiarly by someone from a different, but still one of the major \n<br>speech communities that it would not be recognizable. To be sure, there <br>are the outliers on that bell curve who would need to conform their <br>speech to a dialect in broader use than their own such as they would \n<br>hear on the BBC or from American news outlets. But for most of us, I <br>doubt we would need spelling police. For example, if I write &quot;schedule&quot; <br>with a &quot;k&quot; sound, and a Londoner reads it, I seriously doubt, he would \n<br>have more than a moment&#39;s hesitation in deciphering the word even though <br>he doesn&#39;t pronounce it that way.<br><br>If we start insisting that every word must be spelt in accordance with <br>an arbitrary standard that does not match anyone&#39;s speech completely, \n<br>then we will be back to looking up many words and memorizing their <br>spelling. It is my understanding that in Shakespeare&#39;s time, the idea <br>of proper spelling did not exist, and the Bard was quite content to \n<br>spell a word one way today and differently tomorrow. That apparently <br>didn&#39;t hold him back We all have been prejudiced by our schooling and <br>what Kingsley Read called the &quot;cultural fetish&quot; of spelling to reject \n<br>the idea that we can spell words the way we want. If we go too far <br>astray, our readers won&#39;t understand, and we pay the price of not being <br>read. That by itself, forces a high level of conformism onto the <br>\nsituation, but to insist that we all have to spell in lockstep or be <br>considered morons is quite a different matter.<br><br>I have seen a number of people insist that we have to have standardized <br>spelling or we are doomed, but I doubt anyone has actually studied this \n<br>so we have no real data as to how an alternative English alphabet would <br>work if it did or did not use standardized spelling. For example, let <br>us assume that we don&#39;t insist on standardized spelling and that it was \n<br>later found that that decision slowed the average reading speed by 5 or <br>10 % (I doubt it would be any greater than that). Would that not be a <br>reasonable price to pay to avoid putting ourselves back in the position \n<br>of attempting to memorize how words should be spelt rather than spelling <br>them the way they sound in speech? I believe it would, especially for <br>the dyslexics among us, who cannot deal with arbitrary spellings.<br>\n<br>If a person occasionally is unsure how to spell a word because he <br>suspects he may pronounce it differently than others, he could always <br>look it up in a dictionary. This is better than trying to memorize the <br>\nspelling of virtually his entire vocabulary in order to have it comply <br>with an arbitrary standard of speech.<br><br>Paige<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-856941523q\"><br><br>John Cowan wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; amd64_hacker scripsit:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Personally I&#39;m for abbreviations in all texts.\n<br>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that since QS is meant to be &#39;heard&#39; it shouldn&#39;t matter<br>&gt; &gt; how the word is written but how it is read.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Well, yes, but that slows down reading to the speed of speech. I suspect\n<br>&gt; that rapid silent reading and standardized orthography go together --<br>&gt; we do know that fluent readers recognize familiar words by the total<br>&gt; shape of the word, slowing down only when they must to read an unfamilar\n<br>&gt; word, and that this is equally true in languages that are rationally<br>&gt; spelled, irrationally spelled, or not spelled at all (like Chinese).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So if QS is going to become important for works meant to be read\n<br>&gt; more than once (as opposed to shorthand/transcription uses), a<br>&gt; standardized orthography will have to evolve.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Which immediately leads to the issue of dialects. One&#39;s obvious and<br>&gt; natural phonetic orthography is another&#39;s stumbling block. (&quot;Hmm,\n<br>&gt; is it spelled &#39;theft&#39; or &#39;feft&#39;?&quot; &quot;Hmm, does this mean &#39;lord&#39; or<br>&gt; &#39;laud&#39;?&quot;) A universal orthography ends up needing to make more <br>&gt; distinctions<br>&gt; than any one dialect actually needs, and thus to some extent becoming\n<br>&gt; artificial to all.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -- <br></span>&gt; John Cowan <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cowan%40ccil.org\">cowan@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cowan%25\">\ncowan%</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org/\">40ccil.org</a>&gt;<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-856941523q\"><br>&gt; &quot;Mr. Lane, if you ever wish anything that I can do, all you will have\n<br>&gt; to do will be to send me a telegram asking and it will be done.&quot;<br>&gt; &quot;Mr. Hearst, if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do<br>&gt; anything, you can put the telegram down as a forgery.&quot;\n<br>&gt;<br>&gt; <br><br></span></p></div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-856941523q\"><span style=\"COLOR:white;\"></span> </span></div></div></div></blockquote></div><br><br clear=\"all\"><br>-- <br>Moira O&#39;Brien<br>\n<br>Tel UK:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+44 7831-625990 (UK)<br>Tel Eire&nbsp;&nbsp; +353 876-214532 (Eire)<br>eFax:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+44 8701-337953<br><br>Website:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.moirajane.net\">www.moirajane.net</a><br>Email:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mailto://mj@...\">\nmailto://mj@...</a><br>Messengers:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yahoo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moira_ob<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; MSN:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mj@...\">mj@...</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ICQ:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 233597590<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; AIM:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moira69cd<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Skype:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MoiraJane \n </span></blockquote></div>",
