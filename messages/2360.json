(Most people don&#39;t realize that.) The\n              sound of letter #33 occurs frequently in Britain, as well\n              as New York / New Jersey / New England. In my\n              pronunciation the #33 never occurs at all, as it&#39;s totally\n              replaced by #32. In my speaking the sound of #34 is also\n              almost completely replaced by #32; I have the #32 sound\n              only before an &quot;l&quot; or an &quot;r&quot;, and in dipthongs (in which\n              case it&#39;s not written in QS, of course, since it has\n              specific letters for diphthongs). &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; Anyway, just want to encourage you to look carefully\n              at those, regardless of what conclusions you reach.&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; Kind Regards, &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; Scott&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n          \n      \n      &lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;pre class=&quot;moz-signature&quot; cols=&quot;72&quot;&gt;-- \n&#8220;Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery.&#8221; &#8212; Winston Churchill\n\n\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--------------080001090105070303050802--\r\n\n"
