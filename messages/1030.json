To be sure, there<br/>\n&gt; are the outliers on that bell curve who would need to conform their<br/>\n&gt; speech to a dialect in broader use than their own such as they would<br/>\n&gt; hear on the BBC or from American news outlets. But for most of us, I<br/>\n&gt; doubt we would need spelling police. For example, if I write &quot;schedule&quot;<br/>\n&gt; with a &quot;k&quot; sound, and a Londoner reads it, I seriously doubt, he would<br/>\n&gt; have more than a moment&#39;s hesitation in deciphering the word even though<br/>\n&gt; he doesn&#39;t pronounce it that way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If we start insisting that every word must be spelt in accordance with<br/>\n&gt; an arbitrary standard that does not match anyone&#39;s speech completely,<br/>\n&gt; then we will be back to looking up many words and memorizing their<br/>\n&gt; spelling. It is my understanding that in Shakespeare&#39;s time, the idea<br/>\n&gt; of proper spelling did not exist, and the Bard was quite content to<br/>\n&gt; spell a word one way today and differently tomorrow. That apparently<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t hold him back We all have been prejudiced by our schooling and<br/>\n&gt; what Kingsley Read called the &quot;cultural fetish&quot; of spelling to reject<br/>\n&gt; the idea that we can spell words the way we want. If we go too far<br/>\n&gt; astray, our readers won&#39;t understand, and we pay the price of not being<br/>\n&gt; read. That by itself, forces a high level of conformism onto the<br/>\n&gt; situation, but to insist that we all have to spell in lockstep or be<br/>\n&gt; considered morons is quite a different matter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have seen a number of people insist that we have to have standardized<br/>\n&gt; spelling or we are doomed, but I doubt anyone has actually studied this<br/>\n&gt; so we have no real data as to how an alternative English alphabet would<br/>\n&gt; work if it did or did not use standardized spelling. For example, let<br/>\n&gt; us assume that we don&#39;t insist on standardized spelling and that it was<br/>\n&gt; later found that that decision slowed the average reading speed by 5 or<br/>\n&gt; 10 % (I doubt it would be any greater than that). Would that not be a<br/>\n&gt; reasonable price to pay to avoid putting ourselves back in the position<br/>\n&gt; of attempting to memorize how words should be spelt rather than spelling<br/>\n&gt; them the way they sound in speech? I believe it would, especially for<br/>\n&gt; the dyslexics among us, who cannot deal with arbitrary spellings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If a person occasionally is unsure how to spell a word because he<br/>\n&gt; suspects he may pronounce it differently than others, he could always<br/>\n&gt; look it up in a dictionary. This is better than trying to memorize the<br/>\n&gt; spelling of virtually his entire vocabulary in order to have it comply<br/>\n&gt; with an arbitrary standard of speech.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Paige<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; John Cowan wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; amd64_hacker scripsit:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I&#39;m for abbreviations in all texts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that since QS is meant to be &#39;heard&#39; it shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; matter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; how the word is written but how it is read.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well, yes, but that slows down reading to the speed of speech.
