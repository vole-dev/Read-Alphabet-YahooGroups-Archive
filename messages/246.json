He said the adults opposing reform (as if there \nwas some organized lobby!) always approached the problem from their \npoint of view, not that of a child.\n\nOne side effect to your proposition:  what gets written in the \ntransition time is going to look like a real tossed salad, and will \nappear as nothing but illiterate spelling to most of the planet.  And \nthere is no greater snob than a spelling snob.\n\nShaw himself was adamant that his system use no symbols that could be \nmistaken for old-fashioned Latin typography.  (Except note the &quot;O&quot; \nthat couldn&#39;t be stopped!)  In his quaint, Victorian way, he was \nconcerned that using regular letters might create some embarassing \nand even obscene letter combinations! (One of the few times Shaw was \na product of his times.)\n\nI&#39;d also like to point out that we Americans have been dragging our \nfeet in adopting the metric system for over 100 years, and that \nreform seems almost a piece of cake compared with the inertia that \nwould confront even the most rabid spelling reformer.\n\nSome members of the Shavian group have no interest in reform, but see \nthe alphabet as a practical way to to teach non-English speakers our \ntongue.  I know of a Cambodian fellow of 20 who, right now, is faced \nnot only with learning to spell, but how to write Latin characters \nfor the first time in his life.Talk about a learning curve!  Think \nhow much easier it would be for him to start with a system that made \nsense, where the shapes were the sounds!  Then, maybe after a year, \nand speaking well, he could slowly transition into conventional \northography.\n\nStill, if there ever was a time that spelling reform was practical, \nthis would be it.  With computers able to transliterate any text in \nan instant, people could download the Sunday Times in any spelling \nthey liked, and the cost to the Times of producing such alternative \ntexts would be next to nothing!\n\nStill, I admire your optimism.  All for now......\n\n\n\n&gt;I&#39;ve been doing a little doodling in my spare time.  Writing\n&gt;a &#39;journal&#39; of sorts in Quikscript, just my thoughts that I write a\n&gt;few minutes before each of my classes start.  Also, I&#39;ve developed a\n&gt;script quite similar to Readspel, in fact, based largely on it.  If\n&gt;some don&#39;t know what that is, it&#39;s a system of writing English using\n&gt;most of the letters of the Latin alphabet, but applying the rule\n&gt;of &#39;one letter per sound.&#39;  I figure that a system like this would\n&gt;ease the populous into spelling reform.  Thus, comes my question.\n&gt;\n&gt;Does anyone here actually plan on DOING anything to try to reform\n&gt;spelling?  If so, how do you plan to go about it?  An approach I&#39;d\n&gt;thought of, is to introduce it slowly and gradually.  For example,\n&gt;differentiate between &#39;th&#39; in &quot;this&quot; and &#39;th&#39; in &quot;thing.&quot;  Then,\n&gt;maybe make &#39;ng&#39; one letter.  And gradually, introduce a seperate\n&gt;letter to write each of the consonant sounds that are usually written\n&gt;with more than one (i.e. sh, ch, ng, th, dh).  Note that there would\n&gt;be a small amount of time, a few months let&#39;s say, between each small\n&gt;change, allowing the populous to grow accustomed to the changes. \n&gt;Then, as soon as the consonant sounds are all introduced as one\n&gt;letter, leave that for a while, then introduce a single letter for\n&gt;each of the vowel sounds.  I believe that it can actually BE DONE,\n&gt;but that it would be much easier, and much more accepted, if it were\n&gt;done slowly and gradually.  What do you think?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!

He said the adults\nopposing reform (as if there was some organized lobby!) always\napproached the problem from their point of view, not that of a\nchild.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;One side effect to your proposition:&nbsp; what gets written in\nthe transition time is going to look like a real tossed salad, and\nwill appear as nothing but illiterate spelling to most of the\nplanet.&nbsp; And there is no greater snob than a spelling snob.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Shaw himself was adamant that his system use no symbols that\ncould be mistaken for old-fashioned Latin typography.&nbsp; (Except\nnote the &quot;&lt;font face=&quot;Lionspaw&quot; size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;O&lt;/font&gt;&quot; that\ncouldn&#39;t be stopped!)&nbsp; In his quaint, Victorian way, he was\nconcerned that using regular letters might create some embarassing\nand even obscene letter combinations! (One of the few times Shaw was\na product of his times.)&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I&#39;d also like to point out that we Americans have been dragging\nour feet in adopting the metric system for over 100 years, and&lt;i&gt;\nthat&lt;/i&gt; reform seems almost a piece of cake compared with the\ninertia that would confront even the most rabid spelling\nreformer.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Some members of the Shavian group have no interest in reform,\nbut see the alphabet as a practical way to to teach non-English\nspeakers our tongue.&nbsp; I know of a Cambodian fellow of 20 who,\nright now, is faced not only with learning to spell, but how to write\nLatin characters for the first time in his life.Talk about a learning\ncurve!&nbsp; Think how much easier it would be for him to start with\na system that made sense, where the shapes&lt;i&gt; were&lt;/i&gt; the\nsounds!&nbsp; Then, maybe after a year, and speaking well, he could\nslowly transition into conventional orthography.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Still, if there ever was a time that spelling reform was\npractical, this would be it.&nbsp; With computers able to\ntransliterate any text in an instant, people could download the\nSunday Times in any spelling they liked, and the cost to the Times of\nproducing such alternative texts would be next to nothing!&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Still, I admire your optimism.&nbsp; All for now......&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;blockquote type=&quot;cite&quot; cite&gt;&lt;tt&gt;I&#39;ve been doing a little doodling in\nmy spare time.&nbsp; Writing&lt;br&gt;\na &#39;journal&#39; of sorts in Quikscript, just my thoughts that I write\na&lt;br&gt;\nfew minutes before each of my classes start.&nbsp; Also, I&#39;ve\ndeveloped a&lt;br&gt;\nscript quite similar to Readspel, in fact, based largely on it.&nbsp;\nIf&lt;br&gt;\nsome don&#39;t know what that is, it&#39;s a system of writing English\nusing&lt;br&gt;\nmost of the letters of the Latin alphabet, but applying the rule&lt;br&gt;\nof &#39;one letter per sound.&#39;&nbsp; I figure that a system like this\nwould&lt;br&gt;\nease the populous into spelling reform.&nbsp; Thus, comes my\nquestion.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDoes anyone here actually plan on DOING anything to try to reform&lt;br&gt;\nspelling?&nbsp; If so, how do you plan to go about it?&nbsp; An\napproach I&#39;d&lt;br&gt;\nthought of, is to introduce it slowly and gradually.&nbsp; For\nexample,&lt;br&gt;\ndifferentiate between &#39;th&#39; in &quot;this&quot; and &#39;th&#39; in\n&quot;thing.&quot;&nbsp; Then,&lt;br&gt;\nmaybe make &#39;ng&#39; one letter.&nbsp; And gradually, introduce a\nseperate&lt;br&gt;\nletter to write each of the consonant sounds that are usually\nwritten&lt;br&gt;\nwith more than one (i.e. sh, ch, ng, th, dh).&nbsp; Note that there\nwould&lt;br&gt;\nbe a small amount of time, a few months let&#39;s say, between each\nsmall&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote type=&quot;cite&quot; cite&gt;&lt;tt&gt;change, allowing the populous to\ngrow accustomed to the changes.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\nThen, as soon as the consonant sounds are all introduced as one&lt;br&gt;\nletter, leave that for a while, then introduce a single letter for&lt;br&gt;\neach of the vowel sounds.&nbsp; I believe that it can actually BE\nDONE,&lt;br&gt;\nbut that it would be much easier, and much more accepted, if it\nwere&lt;br&gt;\ndone slowly and gradually.&nbsp; What do you think?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot; color=&quot;#003399&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yahoo!
