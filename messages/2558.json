If you&#39;ve been following the posts \n&gt;&gt; John Cowan and I have been sending back and forth, you&#39;d have noticed \n&gt;&gt; that our speech isn&#39;t necessarily representative of where we&#39;re \n&gt;&gt; from/in, so sampling *us* would&#39;ve been of limited utility. Plus \n&gt;&gt; there&#39;re other things that require *Quikscript* expertise\ufffd\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you&#39;re looking to inject some life into the community, here&#39;re a \n&gt;&gt; few things that I&#39;d like to do, but haven&#39;t quite had the \n&gt;&gt; time/inclination for:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   * Design a largely QWERTY-compatible keyboard layout for Quikscript\n&gt;&gt;     that disunifies parentheses from angle parentheses, omits\n&gt;&gt;     half-letters (use OpenType substitution for that), and doesn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;     throw away any useful other punctuation.\n&gt;&gt;   * Hold a nice, public discussion on what can be safely thrown away\n&gt;&gt;     on a Quikscript keyboard ought to be useful \ufffd King Kong\n&gt;&gt;     &lt;https://github.com/adiabatic/king-kong&gt;&#39;s supported punctuation\n&gt;&gt;     is a strict superset of what&#39;s on a normal US keyboard, but this\n&gt;&gt;     might not be strictly necessary \ufffd and I&#39;m kinda fuzzy on how\n&gt;&gt;     AltGr is supposed to work on keyboards that have that key,\n&gt;&gt;     anyway. At any rate, it&#39;d be nice to learn how AltGr works on\n&gt;&gt;     Windows \ufffd I know that while it&#39;s conceptually similar to the\n&gt;&gt;     Option key on the Mac, I don&#39;t know if AltGr users have\n&gt;&gt;     preexisting expectations on what keys should do what. At any\n&gt;&gt;     rate, there are quite a few keyboard layouts already buried in\n&gt;&gt;     the Files section of this group, and \ufffd speaking as a\n&gt;&gt;     keyboard-layout creator \ufffd get some feedback on what one\n&gt;&gt;     non-experimental layout I should focus most of my time on.\n&gt;&gt;   * Track down all the authors of all the Quikscript fonts that&#39;re\n&gt;&gt;     out there and get them to clarify their license terms \ufffd ideally,\n&gt;&gt;     with an explicit public domain dedication. The term &quot;freeware&quot; is\n&gt;&gt;     ambiguous\n&gt;&gt;     &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#freeware&gt;, and I&#39;d\n&gt;&gt;     rather not allocate my time to playing in someone else&#39;s sandbox.\n&gt;&gt;     As for Kingsley \ufffd tracking down &quot;tinyallen&quot; shouldn&#39;t be\n&gt;&gt;     difficult since he&#39;s been active on the list over the past couple\n&gt;&gt;     days, but I don&#39;t know about Messrs. Stephen Bartok and Oliver\n&gt;&gt;     Langan. At any rate, the copyright field says &quot;Typeface copyright\n&gt;&gt;     High-Logic. 1999, 2002. All Rights Reserved&quot;, but the license\n&gt;&gt;     field says &quot;This is a freeware font.&quot;. Since High-Logic is a\n&gt;&gt;     company that makes font-making software, I&#39;d suspect that it was\n&gt;&gt;     inserted without the original author&#39;s intent \ufffd but I&#39;m not sure.\n&gt;&gt;     At any rate, getting them to publish their font sources \ufffd as a\n&gt;&gt;     UFO &lt;http://unifiedfontobject.org/&gt;, say \ufffd would be great.\n&gt;&gt;   * Figure out, collectively, a NATO alphabet\n&gt;&gt;     &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet&gt; for\n&gt;&gt;     Quikscript (this echoes Tim Rice&#39;s call for better names).\n&gt;&gt;     Ideally, all letters should start with the sound that they&#39;re\n&gt;&gt;     for, not be anything that needs a name dot (i.e. no proper\n&gt;&gt;     names), and be obvious to everyone what each is even when shouted\n&gt;&gt;     over a bad cell-phone connection with significant amounts of\n&gt;&gt;     background noise. This doesn&#39;t need to be the work of one person;\n&gt;&gt;     Google Spreadsheets sounds like the sort of thing that could be\n&gt;&gt;     used to collaborate on all this. This would help me out\n&gt;&gt;     personally, because &quot;ah&quot; and &quot;awe&quot; are homophones to my ears, and\n&gt;&gt;     distinguishing between .Ah/.Awe/.Ox is difficult.\n&gt;&gt;   * Make a nice chart, ideally in HTML using codepoints in the\n&gt;&gt;     Private Use Area, that shows all the letter combinations one\n&gt;&gt;     might reasonably make in Quikscript. This is useful for testing\n&gt;&gt;     kerning and alternate letterforms (does .Utter.Low actually get\n&gt;&gt;     turned into .UtterAlt.Low?) Don&#39;t forget Senior Quikscript\n&gt;&gt;     abbreviations like .Thaw.Ing for &quot;thing&quot;. (Part of) the hard part\n&gt;&gt;     would be designing a layout that&#39;s nice and systematic.\n&gt;&gt;   * Develop a pangram or three that uses every letter in the\n&gt;&gt;     Quikscript alphabet. The closest I&#39;ve come was &quot;What is the price\n&gt;&gt;     of a foot-bath kit? A goose in a dress near North Square thought\n&gt;&gt;     it would cure jelly ankle. The goat nurse suggested palm oil in\n&gt;&gt;     the mouth or wrapped around the ankle with a cloth.&quot; \ufffd which is\n&gt;&gt;     still missing the following sounds: S, Z, tS, j, h, W. Oh, and\n&gt;&gt;     it&#39;s too effing long to fit in my head. The checker I used I&#39;ve\n&gt;&gt;     posted as a gist on GitHub\n&gt;&gt;     &lt;https://gist.github.com/adiabatic/5905628&gt; \ufffd if there&#39;s demand,\n&gt;&gt;     I could redo the thing in Javascript and put it out there on my\n&gt;&gt;     website similar to the Shavian converter\n&gt;&gt;     &lt;http://www.frogorbits.com/qs/from-shavian/&gt;. Again, none of this\n&gt;&gt;     needs to be done as solitary work \ufffd having some back-and-forth\n&gt;&gt;     with others, in public, on things like this&#39;d be nice.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You could also start a blog in Quikscript, as I&#39;ve done. If you&#39;re \n&gt;&gt; having trouble getting it to work right, don&#39;t hesitate to ask on the \n&gt;&gt; list. Similarly, if you&#39;re having trouble getting Quikscript to work \n&gt;&gt; OK in whatever you&#39;re doing, ask on the list. Making QS less annoying \n&gt;&gt; to use on the computer will help adoption, but I don&#39;t know where the \n&gt;&gt; usual pain points are, especially for Windows users who aren&#39;t \n&gt;&gt; computer nerds.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for helping us help you help us all,\n&gt;&gt; Nathan\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Jul 1, 2013, at 12:23 PM, HeyMister &lt;booth.g@... \n&gt;&gt; &lt;mailto:booth.g@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; And now I know why the group is dead.

As for Kingsley \ufffd tracking down\n                            &quot;tinyallen&quot; shouldn&#39;t be difficult since\n                            he&#39;s been active on the list over the past\n                            couple days, but I don&#39;t know about Messrs.\n                            Stephen Bartok and Oliver Langan.
