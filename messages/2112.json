I followed<br/>\nRead&#39;s manual and started with the letters .tea and .no, as well as<br/>\n.it, .eat, .et, .eight, and .at. These are really great, because they<br/>\nform so many words. I even found ones that weren&#39;t in the manual, such<br/>\nas &quot;teen&quot;, &quot;tenant&quot;, and &quot;eighty&quot;. Then I added the letter .aye to the<br/>\npack and found a lot of words that I could write. But then I got<br/>\nstuck: for .ah and .awe, I did not find any words which use only<br/>\nletters previously learned, while for .ox I found only &quot;on&quot;, and for<br/>\n.oy I found only &quot;toy&quot; and &quot;annoy&quot; (at least).<br/>\nNow, I am thinking that to make learning easier, I should maybe add<br/>\nsome of the more frequent consonants before I learn the less frequent<br/>\nvowels. Of I course I could study it brute-force and just write<br/>\nwhatever comes to my head, looking up every letter as I need it, but I<br/>\nwant to make it a more pleasant and more efficient experience. Also,<br/>\nonce I have figured out a nice order, I would publish it along with a<br/>\nlist of example words, so that other people could use it, too.<br/>\nNow here&#39;s my question: do you have any suggestion for the order of<br/>\nletters for learning? and maybe even some example words (or phrases)?<br/>\nthanks!<br/>\nJack</div>",
