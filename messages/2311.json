  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1984383847\">Hey all. I&#39;ve taken the original version of Poe Meets Shaw offline temporarily so I can do a quick retool on it. Doing so will allow me to reduce the costs enough that it&#39;ll be worthwhile to sell through other retailers such as Amazon (definitely) and brick and mortar stores (I hope). It should be back online in no more than about 2 hours. Poe Meets Shaw Condensed will still be available during this time. To the person who bought a copy earlier today, I thank you. You&#39;re the only one to do so, and therefore you&#39;ll be getting an EXTREMELY limited print run (with the 9 I ordered, that&#39;ll make yours copy 10 out of 10). If you can please send me your name and address through e-mail, I&#39;ll make sure to send you a certificate of authenticity as to its limited nature before the week is out.</div>",
