I seldom have to give any thought to which TH sound to \nwrite.  And if I do occasionally hesitate, it is only for a moment.  I \ncam sure that the reason for occasional hesitation is that we all \nlearned TO which doesn&#39;t make the distinction between the two letters.  \nIf children are taught QS in the future, they won&#39;t hesitate at all over \nwhich TH to use.  It certainly is not enough of a problem to justify \nthrowing one of the TH letters out of the alphabet. \n\nOoze and wool are quite distinct from each other and cause me no problem \neither.  My father pronounces Gary Cooper&#39;s name with the wool sound, \nand I use ooze.  We still manage to communicate.  I don&#39;t believe we \nshould throw one sound out as that makes the alphabet less accurate in \nits representation of speech.  I especially like your terminology \n&quot;...provides the comfort of one letter per sound&quot; as if that is some \nsort of compromise.  Isn&#39;t that how an alphabet is supposed to work?   \nIf we throw ooze or wool out, then every time I come across that letter \nin a word, I have to decide which pronunciation it is supposed to have \nin this particular instance.\n\nI understand that for fast reading, we want to limit spelling variants \nto a reasonable number.  But I still believe that the number of variants \nwill be low enough that it will not cause a significant reading speed \ndiminution, and I believe this is borne out by the experience of the \nearly QS writers.  Moira could address that point as well.  Everyone \ndoesn&#39;t have to spell every word the same.\n\nIf I can read &quot;why&quot; written without a wh sound as we now have in the QS \nNews, I&#39;m sure a person who doesn&#39;t use wh can read why written with \nit.  Throwing out wh will just annoy the people to whom it is \nimportant.  Frankly, I don&#39;t think they would agree to it.  I know I won&#39;t.\n\nFor those who merge awe, on and ox or some subset thereof, let them \nspell all these words with on or however they want to.  It will look \npeculiar to me, but I can figure it out just as I&#39;m sure they will \nfigure out what I am talking about. \n\nBy the way, I also pronounce the &quot;l&quot; in the middle of &quot;palm&quot; and \n&quot;calm&quot;.  A &quot;pom&quot; is what I call my dog (Pomeranian).\n\nLoch and Llan don&#39;t bother me one way or the other.  They exist in the \nQS manual, but I&#39;ve never had the need for them.  They can sit there and \nnot bother anybody.  If a font designer leaves them out of his font, the \nvast majority of people won&#39;t care.\n\nPaige\n\n\nAnthony Grahn wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; There seem to be several letter pairs (or triads) that stimulate\n&gt; discussion namely Thaw vs They, Ooze vs Foot, Way vs Way , Ox vs Awe\n&gt; vs Ah.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I understand the underlying point, it is this: the difference in\n&gt; these letters aid reading in some accents and provide the comfort of\n&gt; one letter per sound (grapheme-phoneme correspondence) in certain\n&gt; accents, but these pairings have drawbacks; typically they hinder\n&gt; witting and cause some confusion in other accents.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thaw-They is the most conspicuous.
