For most people who make the<br>&gt; distinction, the word &quot;awe&quot; is just a shorter form of this expression.<br>&gt; When traditional orthography\n writes &quot;au&quot; or &quot;aw&quot;, this generally<br>&gt; represents Awe.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Similarly, Americans, except those from Eastern New England, have trouble<br>&gt; knowing when to write the Ox sound, since most of us use Ah instead.<br>&gt; Traditional spelling is likewise fairly reliable here: if we write &quot;o&quot;<br>&gt; or &quot;wa&quot; it&#39;s Ox, if we write &quot;a&quot; otherwise it&#39;s Ah.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Secondly, what didn&#39;t seem clear to me from Read&#39;s manual was whether<br>&gt;&gt; you should write according to your own pronunciation, or whether there<br>&gt;&gt; was some &#39;master&#39; pronunciation to which you write phonetically.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Read never made that clear.

This is<br>&gt; like what Spanish does in distinguishing in writing between the letters<br>&gt; &quot;s&quot; and &quot;z&quot;, which the great majority of all Spanish-speakers pronounce<br>&gt; the same, but which are pronounced differently in certain parts of Spain,<br>&gt; historically including the capital, the source of the prestige accent<br>&gt; in Spain.

If I can find anything pertinent I wi=\r\nll publish it&lt;BR&gt;to the list.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regards&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Moira&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On Sunday,=\r\n August 30, 2009, John Cowan &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc541.mail.yahoo.com/=\r\nmc/compose?to=3Dcowan%40ccil.org&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D=\r\n&quot;mailto:cowan%40ccil.org&quot;&gt;cowan@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hombredepescado s=\r\ncripsit:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;\n Firstly, I understand that with t=\r\nhe British pronunciation of .Ah&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and .Awe, there would be a cons=\r\niderable difference. However, in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the common North American acce=\r\nnt, I don&#39;t think we pronounce these&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; differently -- do we?&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; About half of North Americans make the distinction. Very roughl=\r\ny,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Eastern and Southern accents do, and Canadian and Western accent=\r\ns don&#39;t.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; All of the other varieties of English make the distinction=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; If yes, then how so?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Most people who =\r\ndon&#39;t make the distinction use only the sound of Ah.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, they =\r\n*do* make the sound of Awe when saying &quot;Awwwwwwww!! !!&quot;, the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; expres=\r\nsion of (mock-)sympathy; we do not mix this up with &quot;Ahhhhhh!&quot;,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the=\r\n sound of satisfaction or relief. For most people who make the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dist=\r\ninction, the word &quot;awe&quot; is just a shorter form of this expression.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nWhen traditional orthography\n writes &quot;au&quot; or &quot;aw&quot;, this generally&lt;BR&gt;&gt; r=\r\nepresents Awe.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Similarly, Americans, except those from East=\r\nern New England, have trouble&lt;BR&gt;&gt; knowing when to write the Ox sound, s=\r\nince most of us use Ah instead.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Traditional spelling is likewise fa=\r\nirly reliable here: if we write &quot;o&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; or &quot;wa&quot; it&#39;s Ox, if we write &quot;a=\r\n&quot; otherwise it&#39;s Ah.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Secondly, what didn&#39;t seem clear t=\r\no me from Read&#39;s manual was whether&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; you should write according =\r\nto your own pronunciation, or whether there&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; was some &#39;master&#39; p=\r\nronunciation to which you write phonetically.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Read never ma=\r\nde that clear. He obviously had an ideal accent in mind,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; which was =\r\nbasically RP, but with &quot;r&quot; where the rhotic accents have it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This l=\r\nist has been working on an &quot;international spelling&quot; that will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; prese=\r\nrve most of the distinctions made by different accents of English,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nat the expense of not\n being quite the same as anyone&#39;s actual accent.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; For example, RP-speakers and Australians will have to distingui=\r\nsh in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; writing between Ah and Start, whereas most North Americans wi=\r\nll have to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; distinguish in writing between Ah and Ox, as I mentioned=\r\n above. This is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; like what Spanish does in distinguishing in writing=\r\n between the letters&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;s&quot; and &quot;z&quot;, which the great majority of all S=\r\npanish-speakers pronounce&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the same, but which are pronounced differ=\r\nently in certain parts of Spain,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; historically including the capital=\r\n, the source of the prestige accent&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in Spain. (English as a whole h=\r\nas no prestige accent.)&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Don&#39;t be so humble. You&#39;=\r\nre not that great.
