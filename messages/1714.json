(For<br/>\nexample, I greatly increased my typing speed when I switched from the<br/>\nQwerty to the Dvorak keyboard layout. It took a few months to reach<br/>\nfull speed, but it was well worth it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be happy to work with you to create a keyboard layout that suits<br/>\nyou. One option, should we go ahead with QS-SAMPA, would be for me to<br/>\ncreate a layout for you that eliminates the change. You could continue<br/>\ntyping exactly as you do now. On the other hand, once we&#39;ve opened up<br/>\nthe possibility, your creativity is set free--you can really consider<br/>\nwhat keyboard assignments would be best for you personally. For<br/>\nexample, you might want to determine the most frequently used QS<br/>\nletters and assign them to the home row on the keyboard. Or you might<br/>\nwant to cluster vowels together on one side of the keyboard and<br/>\nconsonants on the other (a la Dvorak). Whatever you want to do, we can<br/>\ndo it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI fully understand your concern that we not get into an endless cycle<br/>\nof changing the standard every time a font designer thinks up some<br/>\nquirky new system.
