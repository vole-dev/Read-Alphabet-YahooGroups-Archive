Cases of Dropped #3Tea.<br/>\n&gt;  As I said in post 1467, I don&#39;t like the dropped #3Tea in many QS<br/>\n&gt;  news words. An example is &quot;implementing&quot; which was converted<br/>\n&gt;  to ...#28Et-#23No-#26It-#21iNG. Should we put the #3Tea in (to<br/>\n&gt;  get ...#28Et-#23No-#3Tea-#26It-#21iNG), or is the dropped #3Tea a<br/>\n&gt;  widespread Americanism which should remain?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  (Cases of dropped tea - are we revisiting the Boston Tea Party?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  1. Cases of Dropped #19He.<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;Human&quot; was transcribed as #17Ye-#40OOze-#22May-#36Utter-#23No.<br/>\n&gt;  Should this be #19He-#17Ye-#40OOze... or H-dropping the norm in<br/>\n&gt;  America?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  2. Quickscript manual abbreviations<br/>\n&gt;  Should we implement QS manual abbreviations, such as #21iNG (instead<br/>\n&gt;  of -#26It-#21iNG) for the gerund-participle suffix &quot;ing&quot;? Do you<br/>\n&gt;  want to do these one-by-one, or leave them for you to do a global<br/>\n&gt;  update at some point?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  3. Naming dot<br/>\n&gt;  Which character should we use for a naming dot in a text file? Just<br/>\n&gt;  a standard &quot;.&quot;, or something else?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  4. File format<br/>\n&gt;  DO you want DOS or Unix format files? CR-LF, or just LF?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  One area I can certainly help in the dictionary is Korean names. (An<br/>\n&gt;  obscure topic, but there have been a few Korean stories in the QS<br/>\n&gt;  news.) I learnt a little bit of Korean - enough to know that TO<br/>\n&gt;  transcriptions of Korean names can be misleading. In QS we can do<br/>\n&gt;  better!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  (Off topic, but the Korean alphabet, Hangul, was designed in the 15th<br/>\n&gt;  century to reflect the actual sounds of Korean. It&#39;s a brilliant<br/>\n&gt;  piece of work, and many of the letters actually resemble the way the<br/>\n&gt;  letter is articulated in the mouth. So when I first came across<br/>\n&gt;  Quickscript, the similarities to Hangul were striking.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Cheers, Anthony DH<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
