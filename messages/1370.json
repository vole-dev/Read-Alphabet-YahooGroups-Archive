  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2014008282\">I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find Quickscript(QS) a serviceable shorthand. If not<br/>\nas fast as real shorthand, certainly the learning curve is less.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you mean to write connectedly (aka Senior) or unconnectedly (aka<br/>\nJunior) If the former then there is a great deal I&#39;d like to discuss.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy primary thrust now and for the last while is to resolve the<br/>\nambiguous and sparse instructions in the Qucikscript Manual (QM) and<br/>\nthe apparently contradictory examples for connecting letters. You may<br/>\nnote if you write connectedly that the rules seem adequate on a<br/>\nsubjective level but legibility can be a serious issue. Even reading<br/>\nones own writing can be difficult until one builds one&#39;s own rules<br/>\n(subconsciously at least). So to this end I am even now trying to<br/>\ncompose a clear and consistent set of such rules and build a<br/>\nprogrammatic reference implementation of them in order to test these<br/>\nrules for consistency (in previous posts I&#39;ve referred to this loosely<br/>\nas a quickscript senior parser) .

This is long {winded} email on (I think) a new topic.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I joined this group a few days ago and have spent a bit of time <br/>\n&gt; reading most of the messages since 2k1 (yes, my eyes are tired). I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; also taken a look at the posted files. I must say that I admire the <br/>\n&gt; work you&#39;ve all done in pushing Quickscript into the 21st Century.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A bit about me; I&#39;ve been in the workplace over 30 years doing <br/>\n&gt; various things. Most recently I claim the dubious role of software <br/>\n&gt; industry drone with a background in web, database, and application <br/>\n&gt; programming, localization, as well as software and hardware technical <br/>\n&gt; writing. I have university degrees in Creative Writing and Library <br/>\n&gt; Science, for what they are worth.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For decades I&#39;ve kept a diary -- first on paper, then using key entry <br/>\n&gt; on computer, then using palm pilot graffiti. For the past 18 months, <br/>\n&gt; due to my work requirements, I&#39;ve used a combination of a tablet pc <br/>\n&gt; (cursive) and Windows mobile phone pc (again, using graffiti). <br/>\n&gt; Needless to say, I sync heavily between them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Since I first started using graffiti 8 years ago, I recognized the <br/>\n&gt; utility that a true shorthand-base input system would provide to me <br/>\n&gt; in my personal writings. Going from paper to keyboard was a leap <br/>\n&gt; forward as far as efficiency was concerned (I type a casual 40-60 wpm <br/>\n&gt; on my best days); however going from keyboard to graffiti was a step <br/>\n&gt; back -- even when incorporating predictive dictionaries, my input is <br/>\n&gt; pretty slow, requiring a significant time invenstment (there is a <br/>\n&gt; chair in a certain pub nicknamed the &#39;Tungsten&#39; chair, since I sat <br/>\n&gt; there at length many nights journalling on my Palm Pilot and tipping <br/>\n&gt; pints).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Up to this point, I made no move to invest time in learning any <br/>\n&gt; shorthand. What was the point? I&#39;d have to transcribe it by hand <br/>\n&gt; anyway.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, with the tablet pc&#39;s incredibly sophisticated ability to <br/>\n&gt; recognize cursive (it was able to recognize my rather sloppy <br/>\n&gt; handwriting and render into English (US) with *no* training) my dream <br/>\n&gt; of being able to write in shorthand and have on-demand conversion to <br/>\n&gt; text (on not -- as some have pointed out here, shorthand is currently <br/>\n&gt; as good as encryption for the 90% case) is close to reality. The work <br/>\n&gt; being done here on fonts and Unicode is the last piece of the puzzle. <br/>\n&gt; Bravo!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In recent weeks my workload has lightened a bit I&#39;ve been able to <br/>\n&gt; spend some time researching viable shorthand systems, with the <br/>\n&gt; inevitable discovery of Quickscript. It satisfies my personal and <br/>\n&gt; selfish requirements of being an effective, logical, sensible, and <br/>\n&gt; learnable system. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;ve read this far, congratulations, I&#39;m finally getting to the <br/>\n&gt; my questions. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. My anticipated model of usage (once I&#39;m competent in Quickscript) <br/>\n&gt; is as follows:<br/>\n&gt;   a. Write in Quickscript on either my tablet or mobile pc.<br/>\n&gt;   b. Convert to my electronic locale of choice (English (US)) if <br/>\n&gt;      I so choose.<br/>\n&gt;   c. I will never assume that anyone will ever read my raw notes. <br/>\n&gt;      If I want to share something, it will be as a conversion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is this a reasonable model of usage? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2. Given the above, I&#39;d say that I&#39;m intending to use Quickscript as <br/>\n&gt; a personal tool. When sharing, I&#39;ll use standard spelling as (for <br/>\n&gt; lack of a better term) an *escrita franca*, which any literate <br/>\n&gt; English speaker will understand over time, since locale-based <br/>\n&gt; (especially pronunciative) differences are greatly reduced. Since I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; indifferent to anyone understanding my raw notes, questions about how <br/>\n&gt; to use, say, &#39;air&#39; &lt;I say err&gt; or &#39;array&#39; &lt;I say uh-ray&gt; are moot; in <br/>\n&gt; the case of the relatively few gray instances I&#39;ve seen discussed in <br/>\n&gt; this group I&#39;ll simply pick a usage that makes sense to me, stick <br/>\n&gt; with it, and adjust my pc to do a custom correction/conversion in <br/>\n&gt; those cases.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is this an unreasonable expectation to set for myself? I don&#39;t have <br/>\n&gt; any qualms at spending a year or two becoming proficient in a <br/>\n&gt; slightly personalized Quickscript, and in so doing departing from a <br/>\n&gt; proposed universal standard: I&#39;m just like that (for instance, I use <br/>\n&gt; a variant of the US-Dvorak keyboard that I&#39;ve designed to accommodate <br/>\n&gt; my own typing quirks).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. And this, a comment. Given #2, my model actually becomes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   a. Write in a slightly customized Quickscript on either my <br/>\n&gt;      tablet or mobile pc.<br/>\n&gt;   b. Convert to my electronic locale of choice (English (US)) if <br/>\n&gt;      I so choose.<br/>\n&gt;   c. Apply customization to the result, since availble converters <br/>\n&gt;      will likely adhere to the standard being developed by members<br/>\n&gt;      of this group. (Or write a custom converter).<br/>\n&gt;   c. I will still never assume that anyone will ever read my raw<br/>\n&gt;      notes. If I want to share something, it will be as a conversion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m thinking this model, without an intelligent (or locale-based) <br/>\n&gt; converter, is too much to ask the typical prospective Quicksort user <br/>\n&gt; of the future.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s all for now. I&#39;m interested in thoughts about any one of these <br/>\n&gt; items. As always, trim the response -- this email of mine has become <br/>\n&gt; bloated beyond belief. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; thanks<br/>\n&gt; scribbleodd<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
