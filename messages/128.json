I ran across Softy myself today.  I&#39;m still trying\nto figure out whether using Softy with Jerome will permit me to attempt\na more logical remap of the QWERTY keyboard for QS or whether this is\npart of the driver?  As a beginner at this, I&#39;m lost.  How does one tell\nthe computer that you want to press two keys, one after the other, and\nthat the screen should then display the appropriate QS character?\n\nI would like to get more texts on the Read_Alphabet site, but I don&#39;t\nwant to do this until we get a more logical mapping in place.  No point\nin doing it with the old mapping, which I find horrendous!  However, I\nwould like to have a program that would transliterate (?) from the new\nmapping back to the old so that people would be able to copy files from\nthe Shavian mapping to a new Jerome mapping and have them still make\nsense.  I am handicapped in this by being, at best,  semi-computer\nliterate.  I just don&#39;t have time to spend learning all this stuff.  At\nleast, not presently.\n\nBy the way, I went to your website, which I had not seen.  I appreciate\nyour hard work, and it&#39;s good to learn a little more about you.  You are\nan interesting person.  Thanks to the internet, we can get to know each\nother.  I have sort of thought of Dutch as being a germanic language\nsomewhat intermediate between English and German.  Is this inaccurate?\nYour comment that you had not learned too much German in school\nsurprised me.  I guess I thought German would be easier for a Dutch\nspeaker to learn than it is for an English speaker.\n\n I have also spent time learning Esperanto.  Can you make your computer\nshow the accents properly.  Their use of &quot;x&quot; after a letter needing an\naccent just looks so stupid to me.  I expect it is much more difficult\nto find Esperanto speakers here in the U.S. than it is in Europe.\n\nOne last point, when I tried connecting to Read_Alphabet on your site,\nthe link did not work.  I am wondering now whether the underline between\nthe two words was included as it must be?\n\nPaige Gabhart\n\n\n\nEwout Stam wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      -----Oorspronkelijk bericht-----\n&gt;      Van: C.
