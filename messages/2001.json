You can find a clear description of this <br/>\nAlphabet under Pitman Initial Teaching Alphabetat www.omniglot.com<br/>\nor at www.newenglishalphabets.com<br/>\n<br/>\nEnglish as a foreign language is also an interest of mine, and<br/>\nthat is the way I teach it.<br/>\nRegards, Paul V.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
