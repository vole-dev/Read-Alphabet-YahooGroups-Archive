  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-767811176\">Hi All... long time lurker first time poster.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn playing with quickscript and looking at the various fonts available, the mapping of <br/>\nQS onto the existing Latin character range has seemed to be a problem.  I think we <br/>\nshould try to get quickscript into the Unicode standard.  (Please forgive me if this is <br/>\nalready in-progress, but I couldn&#39;t find any information suggesting that on the net.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I think that &quot;Read Alphabet&quot; is a much better name, it is a drawback when trying <br/>\nto do Google searches.  Therefore I have decided upon Quickscript as it is spelled <br/>\nmost often in the QS manual.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have uploaded an image file in the &quot;Resources&quot; directory which I mean to serve as an <br/>\ninitial letter count.  It has several differences to any of the font implementations I <br/>\nhave seen, notably:<br/>\n* includes &#39;full height&#39; angled and squared brackets<br/>\n* includes a &#39;full height&#39; slash character<br/>\n* includes the four alternate &#39;forward baseline&#39; characters (they, may, no, utter)<br/>\n* includes the six half letters (pea, tea, he, way, day, zoo) without &#39;steps&#39; or zig-zags<br/>\n* includes two &#39;step&#39; characters on the top or baseline<br/>\n* includes a &#39;guide&#39; character, indicating the position of the top/baseline<br/>\n   (this looks a bit like a colon, to be used as a writing guide when creating forms etc.)<br/>\n* does NOT include any ligatures (yew, air, are, or, -er)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn total, this amounts to 62 characters, and could be encoded into a 64-character <br/>\nspace on the Unicode table.  Numbers, punctuation, and other existing symbols <br/>\nwould of course be included in Quickscript fonts; but they would be placed at their <br/>\nnormal (i. e. Latin) positions.  The Shavian Unicode implementation does this even for <br/>\nthe namer dot, though I think the mid-dot looks sufficiently different to warrant its <br/>\ninclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease take a look and let me know if you think I&#39;ve missed any.
