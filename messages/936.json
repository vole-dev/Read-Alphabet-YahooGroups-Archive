  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1165226563\">Why /should/ quikscript be adapatable to other languages?  That would <br/>\nrequire it to have symbols for phonemes which English doesn&#39;t have.  The <br/>\nproblem with TO is that is doesn&#39;t meet English&#39;s phoneme needs whereas <br/>\nQS does.  As English phonemes change in the future, then QS will have to <br/>\nadapt to those changes.  Otherwise, in a few centuries, our spelling <br/>\nwould once again not match the pronunciation. <br/>\n<br/>\nRead, of course, was not concerned with devising an alphabet that could <br/>\nbe adapted to other languages.  The fact that the Roman alphabet is used <br/>\nso widely is, I assume, a historical artifact of the Roman empire.  But <br/>\ngrafting the Roman alphabet onto languages too divergent from Latin did <br/>\nnot work all that well, with English being, perhaps, the prime example.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would expect that the problem in using QS for other languages would be <br/>\nthe vowels.  The consonants from one European language to another are <br/>\nlike lighthouses of stability in the stormy sea of vowel fluidity.  So <br/>\nthe consonants could be used fairly easily across the European languages <br/>\nthat I have some familiarity with even though there are differences in <br/>\npronunciation.  The vowels are a different matter.  Additional vowels <br/>\ncould be added to QS to represent sounds from other languages.  But why <br/>\nshould Spanish or German want to use QS when their written languages are <br/>\nquite phonemic already using the Roman alphabet?  I don&#39;t see what <br/>\npurpose it would serve other than trying to decrease the number of <br/>\nalphabets in use in the world.  Is anyone suggesting the Greeks or <br/>\nRussians should adopt the Roman alphabet to make things easier for other <br/>\npeople to learn how to write in those languages?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the pronunciations of words, including the names of cities in <br/>\nforeign countries, I believe they should be written in QS in the closest <br/>\nmanner to the pronunciation of the natives and then pronounced according <br/>\nto that spelling.  In other words, we are not trying to get English <br/>\nspeakers to employ phonemes that don&#39;t exist in English since that is <br/>\nnot likely to work any more than expecting Germans to pronounce &quot;th&quot; in <br/>\na word is likely to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nA mistake that has been made in TO is bringing foreign words into <br/>\nEnglish, continuing to spell them as they were spelled in the foreign <br/>\nlanguage, but pronouncing them differently.
