As I&#39;ve pointed out before, the rules for their usage<br/>\nare so straightforward that it would be a snap to incorporate these<br/>\nletters directly into a QS dictionary.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you write a word such as &#39;hen&#39;? (I&#39;ll use QS-SAMPA in curly<br/>\nbraces again.) I find {hEq} the natural way to write it, not {hEn}. In<br/>\nfact, {hEn} looks quite strange, and slows the reader down. Why would<br/>\nsomeone lift the pen like that? In the same way, words such as &#39;us&#39;<br/>\nand &#39;lull&#39; look much better written {Vs} and {lVl} as opposed to {ys}<br/>\nand {lyl}.
