The retool took somewhat longer than I would have expected (I should have estimated 2 days, not 2 hours), but everything was put back online by 6:09pm today. I&#39;m so happy with the end results that I&#39;ve decided to discount BOTH versions of the book by 20% until the end of January (Pacific Time, aka. GMT-8). I know I said that I&#39;d keep the Condensed version online while the other one was off, but I ended up needing to retool both to get a wider distribution and I also wanted to make sure that nobody felt shafted by paying full retail for the book while so many others got it for a discount. Unless something catastrophic happens, this will be the FINAL revision of the book and it won&#39;t be taken offline again.</div>",
