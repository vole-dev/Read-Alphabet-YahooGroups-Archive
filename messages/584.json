  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-704038872\">Excellent work on the QS font for the fish story example.  I <br/>\nlove &quot;The Old Man and the Sea.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOther posters have covered most of issues that I see in the <br/>\ndocument.  I won&#39;t comment on places where I might have spelled <br/>\nthings differently.  Here are four comments on the font itself:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I&#39;m a little puzzled why the shape of &quot;Utter&quot; is so different from <br/>\nthe shape of &quot;Ever&quot;, &quot;As,&quot; and &quot;On&quot;  Shouldn&#39;t these all look similar?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. As others have pointed out, the shape of &quot;foot&quot; and &quot;ooze&quot; should <br/>\ndefinitely be more rounded.  It&#39;s very difficult to tell &quot;ooze&quot; <br/>\nfrom &quot;eat&quot; with this form.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I&#39;m puzzled why the tail on &quot;May&quot; looks different from the tail <br/>\non &quot;Fee&quot; and &quot;Vie.&quot;  I&#39;d probably not have added the tail at all, but <br/>\ngiven that it&#39;s there, why is it different only on &quot;May&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n4. It&#39;s not clear how the &quot;Awe-Roe&quot; ligature would be different from <br/>\nthe &quot;On-Roe&quot; ligature.  (Did we see &quot;Awe-Roe&quot; in the document?)  A <br/>\nmore acute joining would probably help here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for a glorious addition to the QS universe.  With some <br/>\nminor tweaks, I could see this becoming the new standard for Junior <br/>\nQuickscript typefaces.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards,<br/>\nDelRayVA</div>",
