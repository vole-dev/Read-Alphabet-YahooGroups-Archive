I met with Kingsley Read\n              on a couple of occasions and I corresponded with him for\n              over two years in the mid 60&#39;s in a group which consisted\n              of a Northern irishman, a southern Englishman, Kingsley\n              Read and myself. The whole point of Quikscript is that it\n              is capable of reflecting local ways of speaking - be it\n              American, Australian, Standard English or whatever. It is\n              a phonetic alphabet and that assumes that it will be\n              written as it is spoken.&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n              The abbreviations in Senior QS are the only things that\n              are standardised and they mostly ignore vowels.&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n              Moira&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n              --- In &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n                href=&quot;mailto:Read_Alphabet%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;,\n              &quot;guanolto&quot; &lt;a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-rfc2396E&quot; href=&quot;mailto:scott@...&quot;&gt;&lt;scott@...&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; --- In &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n                href=&quot;mailto:Read_Alphabet%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;,\n              &quot;stratocat6969&quot; &lt;john-bergsma@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; Thanks for your reply. Seeing as my writing will\n              likely never see the light of day, I may take similar\n              liberties with the ending half-t as you have.&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; The file I was referring to is: keybd_read.pdf,\n              and it is in the fonts folder. It turns out I needed to\n              reread the QSM, which answered my question 2). I&#39;m still\n              puzzled about the upper case W however. I might assume\n              that it is supposed to sound like (pardon my attempt at\n              expressing these sounds in a non-standard way) the first\n              syllable of &quot;yuppie&quot;, but it would seem to me that Mr.\n              Read would have advised the combination #17 and #36. Your\n              thoughts?&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; /That&#39;s odd: That was exactly the file I had thought\n              you were referring to, but on it I don&#39;t see any\n              Quikscript letters. Anyway, if it&#39;s the same layout as\n              used for the King Plus font, then at the uppercase W it\n              would be the ligature of letters 26 and 36, intended for\n              use in places like the last two sounds of the word\n              &quot;India.&quot; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; /As you&#39;re starting to notice, there is some\n              individual variation in usage here. Kingsley Read intended\n              for Quikscript to have standard spelling regardless of\n              dialect. But as an American, I&#39;ve come to see that such\n              standardization results in a mass of illogical spellings\n              for most users, ironically something which Quikscript was\n              supposed to eliminate. For that reason, I&#39;ve joined those\n              who use QS according to their own pronunciation -- so I\n              always use the letters &quot;27-36&quot; instead of that ligature\n              you&#39;re mentioning. And &quot;yuppie&quot; would always be &quot;17-36&quot;\n              just as you suggest, regardless. &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; /As to speed of usage, I often wonder that myself:\n              I&#39;ve been using QS for about half a year, and I use it\n              pretty fluidly, most of the time, though still not as fast\n              as the standard Roman alphabet. I can still stare in the\n              direction of a QS text and the meaning doesn&#39;t jump out at\n              me as quickly and inavoidably as it does with orthodox\n              writing. All the best to you with QS.&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; Kind Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; Scott&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n          \n      \n      &lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;pre class=&quot;moz-signature&quot; cols=&quot;72&quot;&gt;-- \n&#8220;Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery.&#8221; &#8212; Winston Churchill\n\n\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--------------060301040002010809080207--\r\n\n"
