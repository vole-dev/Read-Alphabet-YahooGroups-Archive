In a book I<br/>\n&gt;  read several years ago called *Writing Systems,&quot; the author points out<br/>\n&gt;  that Chinese is an effective writing system because it does not try to<br/>\n&gt;  imitate speech. Written Chinese can distinguish between the huge number<br/>\n&gt;  of hononyms that the spoken language cannot. So writing is artificial,<br/>\n&gt;  and QS is artificial in that it dictates we always use &quot;r&#39;s&quot; even for we<br/>\n&gt;  non-rhotic speakers, a very wise rule that Read devised.

Using my Boston accent as a guide seems unwise. On the<br/>\n&gt;  other hand, you are claiming that an experiment conducted 40 years ago<br/>\n&gt;  shows that using your accent as a guide does work. I will have to take<br/>\n&gt;  this on faith.
