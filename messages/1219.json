Does that  \n&gt; also come out as &quot;ah&quot;?  I have difficulty imagining someone saying,  \n&gt; &quot;I stand in ah before God.&quot;  To me that is the sound the doctor  \n&gt; tells you to make before using a tongue depressor, not a separate  \n&gt; word by itself.\n\nIt seems we have several north-american-west-coast English speakers  \non this list, and I think the accent is fairly consistent from San  \nDiego right up into Alaska.  I myself am from San Francisco, but I  \nhave traveled and lived in several countries which use very  \ndifferently-pronounced versions of English and have come to hear the  \ndistinctions between ah, awe and ox.  In my own natural speech, they  \nare distinguished but only very slightly: this often causes people in  \nmy home region to ask where I come from.  I had to choose one of the  \nletters to write the initial sound of my name in QuickScript, and  \nchose awe though my pronunciation is probably closer to ah.\n\nHaving read a few books written in &#39;dialect spelling&#39; (Trainspotting  \nfor one), I have to say that I really prefer having a standard  \nspelling which &#39;washes out&#39; some of the regional differences rather  \nthan having to learn several different spellings for the same word.   \n(I have always had a hell of a time understanding Scottish speakers  \nof English in particular.)  I do not think of QuickScript as a means  \nof writing in ones own dialect, but rather a means of more closely  \n(not exactly) approximating the sounds of the spoken language and  \nreforming spelling.  I took Paul&#39;s original message to be a  \nsuggestion for standardized spelling, though it appears I may have  \nmisjudged that.  In such an endeavor, however, I don&#39;t think we need  \nto slavishly stick to a single source for pronunciation (the OED vs.  \nWebsters vs. ...).  I think the spirit of QuickScript can be noted in  \nRead&#39;s attempts to remove cases of contention, such as using simply  \ning as a suffix rather than choosing between it-ing or eat-ing.\n\nAs an aside, I wonder how one would render the common greeting/ \nappellation/exclaimation &quot;dude,&quot; the way I grew up hearing and  \npronouncing it.  Perhaps day-eat-ooze-day, though there is a dipthong  \nbetween the two vowels which is not well captured by that spelling  \nnor the ye-ooze combination in the QS manual.  It is the same sound  \npeople here on the west coast might make when presented with  \nsomething unappealing to eat, &quot;ewwww.&quot;\n\noliver\n\n\n\r\n--Apple-Mail-3-874074948\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=ISO-8859-1\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;word-wrap: break-word; -khtml-nbsp-mode: space; -khtml=\r\n-line-break: after-white-space; &quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;On Tue 2007.10.30, at 16:2=\r\n7, pgabhart wrote:&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;What I am wondering is ho=\r\nw do you pronounce the word &quot;awe&quot; itself as in what one experiences in conn=\r\nection with the deity?=A0 Does that also come out as &quot;ah&quot;?=A0 I have diffic=\r\nulty imagining someone saying, &quot;I stand in ah before God.&quot;=A0 To me that is=\r\n the sound the doctor tells you to make before using a tongue depressor, no=\r\nt a separate word by itself.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D&quot;Apple-style-s=\r\npan&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR class=3D&quot;khtml-block-placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;It seems we have seve=\r\nral north-american-west-coast English speakers on this list, and I think th=\r\ne accent is fairly consistent from San Diego right up into Alaska.=A0 I mys=\r\nelf am from San Francisco, but I have traveled and lived in several countri=\r\nes which use very differently-pronounced versions of English and have come =\r\nto hear the distinctions between &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;ah&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;,=A0&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;awe&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;=A0an=\r\nd &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;ox&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;.=A0 In my own natural speech, they are distinguished but=\r\n only very slightly: this often causes people in my home region to ask wher=\r\ne I come from.=A0 I had to choose one of the letters to write the initial s=\r\nound of my name in QuickScript, and chose &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;awe&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;=A0though my pro=\r\nnunciation is probably closer to &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;ah&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;khtml-block-placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Having read a few books written i=\r\nn &#39;dialect spelling&#39; (&lt;I&gt;Trainspotting&lt;/I&gt; for one), I have to say that I r=\r\neally prefer having a standard spelling which &#39;washes out&#39; some of the regi=\r\nonal differences rather than having to learn several different spellings fo=\r\nr the same word.=A0 (I have always had a hell of a time understanding Scott=\r\nish speakers of English in particular.)=A0 I do &lt;I&gt;not&lt;/I&gt;=A0think of Quick=\r\nScript as a means of writing in ones own dialect, but rather a means of mor=\r\ne closely (not exactly) approximating the sounds of the spoken language and=\r\n reforming spelling.=A0=A0I took Paul&#39;s original message to be a suggestion=\r\n for standardized spelling, though it appears I may have misjudged that.=A0=\r\n In such an endeavor, however, I don&#39;t think we need to slavishly stick to =\r\na single source for pronunciation (the OED vs. Websters vs. ...).=A0 I thin=\r\nk the spirit of QuickScript can be noted in Read&#39;s attempts to remove cases=\r\n of contention, such as using simply &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;ing&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;=A0as a suffix rather=\r\n than choosing between &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;it-ing&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;=A0or &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;eat-ing&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;I&gt;.&lt;=\r\n/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR class=3D&quot;khtml-block-placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=\r\n=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;As an aside, I wonder how one would render the common=\r\n greeting/appellation/exclaimation &quot;dude,&quot; the way I grew up hearing and pr=\r\nonouncing it.=A0 Perhaps &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;day-eat-ooze-day&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;, though there is a =\r\ndipthong between the two vowels which is not well captured by that spelling=\r\n nor the &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;ye-ooze&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;=A0combination in the QS manual.=A0 It is the=\r\n same sound people here on the west coast might make when presented with so=\r\nmething unappealing to eat, &quot;ewwww.&quot;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR class=3D&quot;khtml-bl=\r\nock-placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;oliver&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR class=3D&quot;khtml-block-place=\r\nholder&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-3-874074948--\r\n\n"
