People may find it<br/>\n&gt;  attractive in spite of the fact that it will constitute a<br/>\n&gt;  compromise between an ASCII transliteration *of<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript* and yet another quasi-phonemic ASCII<br/>\n&gt;  transcription of English.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  mappings which differ between BPJ 1 and BPJ 2.1<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  | QS # |(Jerome)| Name | BPJ 1| BPJ 2.1 |<br/>\n&gt;  |------|--------|-------------|------|-------------|<br/>\n&gt;  | #14 | Z | J&#39;ai | Z | J * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #16 | J | Jay | J | j * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #17 | j | Ye | j | y * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #31 | F | I | A * | Y * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #32 | y | Ah | q * | A * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #35 | q | Oy | O * | q |<br/>\n&gt;  | #36 | a | Utter | y * | u * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #37 | Q | Out | Y * | B * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #39 | U | Foot | u * | V * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #38 | O | Owe | B * | O |<br/>\n&gt;  | #36.2| u | Up | V * | C * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #12.5| L | half-Zoo | C * | Z * |<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript-ASCII as a transliteration<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Any mapping of Quikscript letters to ASCII letters will in<br/>\n&gt;  effect be a transliteration, and as such it must be easy<br/>\n&gt;  to read even if displayed in a normal ASCII font rather<br/>\n&gt;  than a Quikscript font, because there will be times, more<br/>\n&gt;  or less frequent, when we will be reading transcribed text<br/>\n&gt;  without having the time or opportunity to view it in a<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript font.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The signalling function of capitalization<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The more I think of it the more convinced I get that in an<br/>\n&gt;  ASCII mapping of Quikscript the ASCII lowercase letters<br/>\n&gt;  should as far as possible be mapped to their regular<br/>\n&gt;  Traditional Orthography sounds - say their sounds as they<br/>\n&gt;  would say when teaching spelling in school - while the ASCII<br/>\n&gt;  uppercase letters should be used to signal their own<br/>\n&gt;  otherness.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Other vowel mappings<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The lowercase ASCII vowel letters<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  For that reason the five lowercase vowel letters _i, e, a,<br/>\n&gt;  o, u_ should be mapped to #26, #28, #30, #34, #36, _j_ and<br/>\n&gt;  _y_ to #16 and #17 and so on for all the Traditional<br/>\n&gt;  Orthography single letters which have a default phoneme<br/>\n&gt;  correspondence.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The ASCII uppercase vowel letters<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Once the system of marking Quikscript paired vowels with<br/>\n&gt;  capitalization has been abandoned by the remapping of {u}<br/>\n&gt;  and {y} there is no point in keeping ASCII {A, O, Y} for<br/>\n&gt;  #31, #35, #37; indeed these mappings become more misleading<br/>\n&gt;  than the old uppercase {F} for #31, since people will expect<br/>\n&gt;  them to be mapped to vowels, but these sounds are never<br/>\n&gt;  written with these Traditional Orthography letters, unlike<br/>\n&gt;  _I_ and _E_ which at least map to the sounds of #27 and #29<br/>\n&gt;  in recent french loans like _machine_ and _ballet_. It<br/>\n&gt;  becomes better to use uppercase {Y} for #31, since this<br/>\n&gt;  letter and sound are associated in Traditional Orthography<br/>\n&gt;  (_my, rye, edify, hyphen_). It is also obviously better to<br/>\n&gt;  map ASCII uppercase {A} to #32, since this sound is always<br/>\n&gt;  written _a_ in accents like RP which maintain the three-way<br/>\n&gt;  contrast between #32, #33, #34. In the same vein ASCII<br/>\n&gt;  uppercase {O} can be conveniently mapped to #38, which is<br/>\n&gt;  &#39;the long sound of _o_&#39; in Traditional Orthography. For #33<br/>\n&gt;  we will map uppercase {Q} also in this mapping, if onlu<br/>\n&gt;  because we will need to map _Q_ to some Quikscript letter,<br/>\n&gt;  and at least uppercase {Q} looks like uppercase {O} with a<br/>\n&gt;  squiggle, just like #33 looks like #34 with a squiggle!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript vowel letters mapped to ASCII consonant<br/>\n&gt;  letters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  This will leave ASCII {q} as the odd man out among the ASCII<br/>\n&gt;  lowercase letters; I have mapped it to #35, not only because<br/>\n&gt;  it is the old mapping, but also because lowercase _q_ does<br/>\n&gt;  have some similarity, to the Quikscript letter itself \u2014 a<br/>\n&gt;  loop with a downwards tail to the right \u2014 as well as to the<br/>\n&gt;  Traditional Orthography digraph _oy_.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  With lowercase {u} mapped to #36 some other ASCII letter<br/>\n&gt;  must be found for #39, and after some consideration I have<br/>\n&gt;  come to the conclusion that uppercase {V}, as proposed by<br/>\n&gt;  Ted Larson freeman, is indeed the best choice: it looks<br/>\n&gt;  similar to the Quikscript letter, and historically the<br/>\n&gt;  Traditional Orthography letters _U_ and _V_[^3] were variant<br/>\n&gt;  forms of the same letter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ASCII uppercase {B} will still be mapped to a vowel, and<br/>\n&gt;  now memory-cued to the word &quot;bout&quot;, and probably those who<br/>\n&gt;  are familiar with the _&#x0223;_ ligature form of the _ou_<br/>\n&gt;  digraph will be aided by its visual similarity to<br/>\n&gt;  uppercase _B_.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I choose to map ASCII uppercase {C} to alternate #36, since<br/>\n&gt;  Ted Larson Freeman brought the graphic similarity between<br/>\n&gt;  these letters of the two alphabets to attention, and with<br/>\n&gt;  {V} mapped to #39 no other of the available uppercase letter<br/>\n&gt;  fits better. That uppercase {C} is more readable than<br/>\n&gt;  lowercase in this role, especially next to {k}, because<br/>\n&gt;  capitalization serves to signal that C does not have any of<br/>\n&gt;  the usual sound values of Traditional Orthography c, nor,<br/>\n&gt;  indeed, marks a vowel is easily seen by comparing {skClpcur,<br/>\n&gt;  akCmpliS, surkCs, kClcurCl, kCstCm} (or {kCsFCm}) with<br/>\n&gt;  {skclpCur, akcmpliS, surkcs, kclCurcl, kcstcm} (or {kcsFcm})<br/>\n&gt;  for _sculpture, accomplish, circus, cultural, custom_. There<br/>\n&gt;  are, not counting derivations, some 30 words where #5 and<br/>\n&gt;  #15 occur next to each other[^4], but I deem these to be of<br/>\n&gt;  far less text frequency than in particular the combinations<br/>\n&gt;  #36+#24 and #36+#22, espescially if one considers that<br/>\n&gt;  several of these words have alternative pronunciations with<br/>\n&gt;  #3+#17 instead of #15, and thus should perhaps be spelled<br/>\n&gt;  accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Funnily enough, I find the spellings above with lower-case c for<br/>\nalternative #36 quite readable. The similarity between lower-case u<br/>\nand lower-case c is also nice for this allographic pair. In addition,<br/>\nI like seeing upper-case C for #15. To me, the upper case nicely<br/>\nsignals a tall QS consonant. Let&#39;s do some more comparisons, as you<br/>\nsuggested earlier. I&#39;ll write a script to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTed<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  Consonant mappings<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The remaining Quikscript letters must and should be mapped<br/>\n&gt;  to uppercase ASCII letters. The Traditional Orthography<br/>\n&gt;  equivalents of these Quikscript letters will normally be<br/>\n&gt;  digraphs, and as a general principle the uppercase ASCII<br/>\n&gt;  character choosen to represent them should correspond to<br/>\n&gt;  one of the letters of these digraph. There will, even must,<br/>\n&gt;  be deviations from this principle, but these should be well<br/>\n&gt;  grounded and provided with good memory-cues. As it turns<br/>\n&gt;  out only _T, S, W_ for #7, #13, #20 will more or less<br/>\n&gt;  unproblematically follow this principle. Analogy then<br/>\n&gt;  suggests that _D, C, Z, N_ be mapped to #8, #14, #15, #21,<br/>\n&gt;  but again it turns out that only {D} #8 will stand<br/>\n&gt;  relatively unaffected by other considerations. Traditional<br/>\n&gt;  Orthography never writes the sound of #8 with a spelling<br/>\n&gt;  containing the letter _d_, but the analogy to _T_ for #7 is<br/>\n&gt;  relatively flawless here. Not so with the sound of #14:<br/>\n&gt;  spellings with _z_ corresponding to this sound are<br/>\n&gt;  virtually confined to the use of _zh_ in transcribed<br/>\n&gt;  Russian names. The Traditional Orthography consonant letter<br/>\n&gt;  most regularly associated with this sound is actually _s_,<br/>\n&gt;  but there is another Traditional Orthography letter which<br/>\n&gt;  is fairly regularly associated with the sound, namely _j_<br/>\n&gt;  in recent French loan words. This suggests uppercase {J} as<br/>\n&gt;  the best mapping for #14, as does the fact that words like<br/>\n&gt;  garage and mirage have variant pronunciations with #16.<br/>\n&gt;  There is also the fact to consider that uppercase ASCII<br/>\n&gt;  letters which don&#39;t get mapped to basic or alternate<br/>\n&gt;  letters will almost inevitably end up mapped to half-<br/>\n&gt;  letters, whether we include those in our &#39;official&#39;<br/>\n&gt;  proposals or not, and it seems much better to map the ASCII<br/>\n&gt;  uppercase {Z} to the frequently used half-z and ASCII<br/>\n&gt;  uppercase {J} to #14 than the other way around!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  With #21 the problem is somewhat different. What causes<br/>\n&gt;  problems here is that ASCII uppercase {N} is clearly the<br/>\n&gt;  best, not to say the only reasonable, mapping for the<br/>\n&gt;  alternate #23, and thus ASCII uppercase {G} emerges as the<br/>\n&gt;  best mapping for #21 as discussed previously.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Similar considerations apply to #15. From a practical point<br/>\n&gt;  of view ASCII uppercase and lowercase {C}-{c} are equally<br/>\n&gt;  suitable for #15 once it is understood that #5 is ASCII {k}<br/>\n&gt;  and #11 is ASCII {s}, but since any ASCII letter not mapped<br/>\n&gt;  to a basic Quikscript letter will have to be mapped to a<br/>\n&gt;  sound not normally associated with with the Traditional<br/>\n&gt;  Orthography letter _c_ it is better to let the signal value<br/>\n&gt;  of capitalization come into play with this other mapping,<br/>\n&gt;  since lowercase _c_ is at least part of the default<br/>\n&gt;  Traditional Orthography spelling for #15.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  List of mappings in BPJ 2.1<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  (Again mappings with a following * differ from Jerome kmap,<br/>\n&gt;  and the half-letters with an * after their name are not<br/>\n&gt;  found in the Quikscript Manual.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  | QS # |(Jerome)| Name | BPJ 2|<br/>\n&gt;  |------|--------|-------------|------|<br/>\n&gt;  | #1 | p | Pea | p |<br/>\n&gt;  | #2 | b | Bay | b |<br/>\n&gt;  | #3 | t | Tea | t |<br/>\n&gt;  | #4 | d | Day | d |<br/>\n&gt;  | #5 | k | Key | k |<br/>\n&gt;  | #6 | g | Gay | g |<br/>\n&gt;  | #7 | T | Thaw | T |<br/>\n&gt;  | #8 | H | They | D * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #9 | f | Fee | f |<br/>\n&gt;  | #10 | v | Vie | v |<br/>\n&gt;  | #11 | s | See | s |<br/>\n&gt;  | #12 | z | Zoo | z |<br/>\n&gt;  | #13 | S | She | S |<br/>\n&gt;  | #14 | Z | J&#39;ai | J * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #15 | c | Cheer | c |<br/>\n&gt;  | #16 | J | Jay | j * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #17 | j | Ye | y * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #18 | w | Way | w |<br/>\n&gt;  | #19 | h | He | h |<br/>\n&gt;  | #20 | ` | Why | W * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #21 | N | Ing | G * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #22 | m | May | m |<br/>\n&gt;  | #23 | n | No | n |<br/>\n&gt;  | #24 | l | Low | l |<br/>\n&gt;  | #25 | r | Roe | r |<br/>\n&gt;  | #26 | i | It | i |<br/>\n&gt;  | #27 | I | Eat | I |<br/>\n&gt;  | #28 | e | Et | e |<br/>\n&gt;  | #29 | E | Eight | E |<br/>\n&gt;  | #30 | A | At | a * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #31 | F | I | Y * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #32 | y | Ah | A * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #33 | Y | Awe | Q * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #34 | o | Ox | o |<br/>\n&gt;  | #35 | q | Oy | q * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #36 | a | Utter | u * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #37 | Q | Out | B * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #38 | O | Owe | O |<br/>\n&gt;  | #39 | U | Foot | V * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #40 | M | Ooze | U * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #41 | \u00e7 | Loch | K * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #42 | \u00e6 | Llan | L * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #43 | \u00e8 | Excite | x * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #44 | \u00e9 | Exam | X * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #23.2| G | Noon | N * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #36.2| u | Up | C * |<br/>\n&gt;  | - | / | naming dot | ` * |<br/>\n&gt;  | - | | left bracket| ( |<br/>\n&gt;  | - | |right bracket| ) |<br/>\n&gt;  | #1.5 | ] | half-Pea | P * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #3.5 | [ | half-Tea | F * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #4.5 | B | half-Day | R * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #12.5| L | half-Zoo | Z * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #17.5| ^ | half-Ye * | ^ |<br/>\n&gt;  | #18.5| @ | half-Way | M * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #19.5| &#92;&#92; (&#92;&#92;)| half-He | H * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #20.5| ~ | half-Why * | ~ |<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Footnotes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  [^3]: Originally _V\u2014u_ constituted an upper-lowercase pair.<br/>\n&gt;  The split into two letters was invented in the 16th century<br/>\n&gt;  and completed in the 18th.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  See &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U</a>&gt;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  [^4]: actual, actuary, actuate, architecture, beachcomber,<br/>\n&gt;  beechcraft, chukchi, conjecture, contractual, effectuate,<br/>\n&gt;  factual, fluctuate, fracture, hutchcraft, inchcape,<br/>\n&gt;  ineffectual, infrastructure, intellectual, juncture,<br/>\n&gt;  latchkey, lecture, manufacture, picture, prefecture,<br/>\n&gt;  punctuate, puncture, sanctuary, stricture, structure,<br/>\n&gt;  tincture, witchcraft.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Source: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict\">http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  See<br/>\n&gt;  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMU_Pronouncing_Dictionary\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMU_Pronouncing_Dictionary</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  19.12.2007 Benct Philip Jonsson &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bpj@...\">bpj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  }<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",

It\n&gt;  becomes better to use uppercase {Y} for=\r\n #31, since this\n&gt;  letter and sound are associated in Traditional Orthogra=\r\nphy\n&gt;  (_my, rye, edify, hyphen_). It is also obviously better to\n&gt;  map AS=\r\nCII uppercase {A} to #32, since this sound is always\n&gt;  written _a_ in acce=\r\nnts like RP which maintain the three-way\n&gt;  contrast between #32, #33, #34.=\r\n In the same vein ASCII\n&gt;  uppercase {O} can be conveniently mapped to #38,=\r\n which is\n&gt;  &#39;the long sound of _o_&#39; in Traditional Orthography. For #33\n&gt; =\r\n we will map uppercase {Q} also in this mapping, if onlu\n&gt;  because we will=\r\n need to map _Q_ to some Quikscript letter,\n&gt;  and at least uppercase {Q} l=\r\nooks like uppercase {O} with a\n&gt;  squiggle, just like #33 looks like #34 wi=\r\nth a squiggle!\n&gt;\n&gt;  Quikscript vowel letters mapped to ASCII consonant\n&gt;  l=\r\netters.\n&gt;\n&gt;  This will leave ASCII {q} as the odd man out among the ASCII\n&gt;=\r\n  lowercase letters; I have mapped it to #35, not only because\n&gt;  it is the=\r\n old mapping, but also because lowercase _q_ does\n&gt;  have some similarity, =\r\nto the Quikscript letter itself =97 a\n&gt;  loop with a downwards tail to the =\r\nright =97 as well as to the\n&gt;  Traditional Orthography digraph _oy_.\n&gt;\n&gt;  W=\r\nith lowercase {u} mapped to #36 some other ASCII letter\n&gt;  must be found fo=\r\nr #39, and after some consideration I have\n&gt;  come to the conclusion that u=\r\nppercase {V}, as proposed by\n&gt;  Ted Larson freeman, is indeed the best choi=\r\nce: it looks\n&gt;  similar to the Quikscript letter, and historically the\n&gt;  T=\r\nraditional Orthography letters _U_ and _V_[^3] were variant\n&gt;  forms of the=\r\n same letter.\n&gt;\n&gt;  ASCII uppercase {B} will still be mapped to a vowel, and=\r\n\n&gt;  now memory-cued to the word &quot;bout&quot;, and probably those who\n&gt;  are famil=\r\niar with the _&#x0223;_ ligature form of the _ou_\n&gt;  digraph will be aided =\r\nby its visual similarity to\n&gt;  uppercase _B_.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I choose to map ASCII up=\r\npercase {C} to alternate #36, since\n&gt;  Ted Larson Freeman brought the graph=\r\nic similarity between\n&gt;  these letters of the two alphabets to attention, a=\r\nnd with\n&gt;  {V} mapped to #39 no other of the available uppercase letter\n&gt;  =\r\nfits better. That uppercase {C} is more readable than\n&gt;  lowercase in this =\r\nrole, especially next to {k}, because\n&gt;  capitalization serves to signal th=\r\nat C does not have any of\n&gt;  the usual sound values of Traditional Orthogra=\r\nphy c, nor,\n&gt;  indeed, marks a vowel is easily seen by comparing {skClpcur,=\r\n\n&gt;  akCmpliS, surkCs, kClcurCl, kCstCm} (or {kCsFCm}) with\n&gt;  {skclpCur, ak=\r\ncmpliS, surkcs, kclCurcl, kcstcm} (or {kcsFcm})\n&gt;  for _sculpture, accompli=\r\nsh, circus, cultural, custom_. There\n&gt;  are, not counting derivations, some=\r\n 30 words where #5 and\n&gt;  #15 occur next to each other[^4], but I deem thes=\r\ne to be of\n&gt;  far less text frequency than in particular the combinations\n&gt;=\r\n  #36+#24 and #36+#22, espescially if one considers that\n&gt;  several of thes=\r\ne words have alternative pronunciations with\n&gt;  #3+#17 instead of #15, and =\r\nthus should perhaps be spelled\n&gt;  accordingly.\n\nFunnily enough, I find the =\r\nspellings above with lower-case c for\nalternative #36 quite readable. The s=\r\nimilarity between lower-case u\nand lower-case c is also nice for this allog=\r\nraphic pair. In addition,\nI like seeing upper-case C for #15. To me, the up=\r\nper case nicely\nsignals a tall QS consonant. Let&#39;s do some more comparisons=\r\n, as you\nsuggested earlier. I&#39;ll write a script to do it.\n\nTed\n\n\n&gt;  Consona=\r\nnt mappings\n&gt;\n&gt;  The remaining Quikscript letters must and should be mapped=\r\n\n&gt;  to uppercase ASCII letters. The Traditional Orthography\n&gt;  equivalents =\r\nof these Quikscript letters will normally be\n&gt;  digraphs, and as a general =\r\nprinciple the uppercase ASCII\n&gt;  character choosen to represent them should=\r\n correspond to\n&gt;  one of the letters of these digraph. There will, even mus=\r\nt,\n&gt;  be deviations from this principle, but these should be well\n&gt;  ground=\r\ned and provided with good memory-cues. As it turns\n&gt;  out only _T, S, W_ fo=\r\nr #7, #13, #20 will more or less\n&gt;  unproblematically follow this principle=\r\n. Analogy then\n&gt;  suggests that _D, C, Z, N_ be mapped to #8, #14, #15, #21=\r\n,\n&gt;  but again it turns out that only {D} #8 will stand\n&gt;  relatively unaff=\r\nected by other considerations. Traditional\n&gt;  Orthography never writes the =\r\nsound of #8 with a spelling\n&gt;  containing the letter _d_, but the analogy t=\r\no _T_ for #7 is\n&gt;  relatively flawless here. Not so with the sound of #14:\n=\r\n&gt;  spellings with _z_ corresponding to this sound are\n&gt;  virtually confined=\r\n to the use of _zh_ in transcribed\n&gt;  Russian names. The Traditional Orthog=\r\nraphy consonant letter\n&gt;  most regularly associated with this sound is actu=\r\nally _s_,\n&gt;  but there is another Traditional Orthography letter which\n&gt;  i=\r\ns fairly regularly associated with the sound, namely _j_\n&gt;  in recent Frenc=\r\nh loan words. This suggests uppercase {J} as\n&gt;  the best mapping for #14, a=\r\ns does the fact that words like\n&gt;  garage and mirage have variant pronuncia=\r\ntions with #16.\n&gt;  There is also the fact to consider that uppercase ASCII\n=\r\n&gt;  letters which don&#39;t get mapped to basic or alternate\n&gt;  letters will alm=\r\nost inevitably end up mapped to half-\n&gt;  letters, whether we include those =\r\nin our &#39;official&#39;\n&gt;  proposals or not, and it seems much better to map the =\r\nASCII\n&gt;  uppercase {Z} to the frequently used half-z and ASCII\n&gt;  uppercase=\r\n {J} to #14 than the other way around!\n&gt;\n&gt;  With #21 the problem is somewha=\r\nt different. What causes\n&gt;  problems here is that ASCII uppercase {N} is cl=\r\nearly the\n&gt;  best, not to say the only reasonable, mapping for the\n&gt;  alter=\r\nnate #23, and thus ASCII uppercase {G} emerges as the\n&gt;  best mapping for #=\r\n21 as discussed previously.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Similar considerations apply to #15. From =\r\na practical point\n&gt;  of view ASCII uppercase and lowercase {C}-{c} are equa=\r\nlly\n&gt;  suitable for #15 once it is understood that #5 is ASCII {k}\n&gt;  and #=\r\n11 is ASCII {s}, but since any ASCII letter not mapped\n&gt;  to a basic Quiksc=\r\nript letter will have to be mapped to a\n&gt;  sound not normally associated wi=\r\nth with the Traditional\n&gt;  Orthography letter _c_ it is better to let the s=\r\nignal value\n&gt;  of capitalization come into play with this other mapping,\n&gt; =\r\n since lowercase _c_ is at least part of the default\n&gt;  Traditional Orthogr=\r\naphy spelling for #15.\n&gt;\n&gt;  List of mappings in BPJ 2.1\n&gt;\n&gt;  (Again mapping=\r\ns with a following * differ from Jerome kmap,\n&gt;  and the half-letters with =\r\nan * after their name are not\n&gt;  found in the Quikscript Manual.)\n&gt;\n&gt;  | QS=\r\n # |(Jerome)| Name | BPJ 2|\n&gt;  |------|--------|-------------|------|\n&gt;  | =\r\n#1 | p | Pea | p |\n&gt;  | #2 | b | Bay | b |\n&gt;  | #3 | t | Tea | t |\n&gt;  | #4 =\r\n| d | Day | d |\n&gt;  | #5 | k | Key | k |\n&gt;  | #6 | g | Gay | g |\n&gt;  | #7 | T=\r\n | Thaw | T |\n&gt;  | #8 | H | They | D * |\n&gt;  | #9 | f | Fee | f |\n&gt;  | #10 |=\r\n v | Vie | v |\n&gt;  | #11 | s | See | s |\n&gt;  | #12 | z | Zoo | z |\n&gt;  | #13 |=\r\n S | She | S |\n&gt;  | #14 | Z | J&#39;ai | J * |\n&gt;  | #15 | c | Cheer | c |\n&gt;  | =\r\n#16 | J | Jay | j * |\n&gt;  | #17 | j | Ye | y * |\n&gt;  | #18 | w | Way | w |\n&gt; =\r\n | #19 | h | He | h |\n&gt;  | #20 | ` | Why | W * |\n&gt;  | #21 | N | Ing | G * |=\r\n\n&gt;  | #22 | m | May | m |\n&gt;  | #23 | n | No | n |\n&gt;  | #24 | l | Low | l |\n=\r\n&gt;  | #25 | r | Roe | r |\n&gt;  | #26 | i | It | i |\n&gt;  | #27 | I | Eat | I |\n&gt;=\r\n  | #28 | e | Et | e |\n&gt;  | #29 | E | Eight | E |\n&gt;  | #30 | A | At | a * |=\r\n\n&gt;  | #31 | F | I | Y * |\n&gt;  | #32 | y | Ah | A * |\n&gt;  | #33 | Y | Awe | Q =\r\n* |\n&gt;  | #34 | o | Ox | o |\n&gt;  | #35 | q | Oy | q * |\n&gt;  | #36 | a | Utter =\r\n| u * |\n&gt;  | #37 | Q | Out | B * |\n&gt;  | #38 | O | Owe | O |\n&gt;  | #39 | U | =\r\nFoot | V * |\n&gt;  | #40 | M | Ooze | U * |\n&gt;  | #41 | =E7 | Loch | K * |\n&gt;  |=\r\n #42 | =E6 | Llan | L * |\n&gt;  | #43 | =E8 | Excite | x * |\n&gt;  | #44 | =E9 | =\r\nExam | X * |\n&gt;  | #23.2| G | Noon | N * |\n&gt;  | #36.2| u | Up | C * |\n&gt;  | -=\r\n | / | naming dot | ` * |\n&gt;  | - | | left bracket| ( |\n&gt;  | - | |right brac=\r\nket| ) |\n&gt;  | #1.5 | ] | half-Pea | P * |\n&gt;  | #3.5 | [ | half-Tea | F * |\n=\r\n&gt;  | #4.5 | B | half-Day | R * |\n&gt;  | #12.5| L | half-Zoo | Z * |\n&gt;  | #17.=\r\n5| ^ | half-Ye * | ^ |\n&gt;  | #18.5| @ | half-Way | M * |\n&gt;  | #19.5| &#92;&#92; (&#92;&#92;)=\r\n| half-He | H * |\n&gt;  | #20.5| ~ | half-Why * | ~ |\n&gt;\n&gt;  Footnotes\n&gt;\n&gt;  [^3]=\r\n: Originally _V=97u_ constituted an upper-lowercase pair.\n&gt;  The split into=\r\n two letters was invented in the 16th century\n&gt;  and completed in the 18th.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  See &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U&gt;.\n&gt;\n&gt;  [^4]: actual, actuary, act=\r\nuate, architecture, beachcomber,\n&gt;  beechcraft, chukchi, conjecture, contra=\r\nctual, effectuate,\n&gt;  factual, fluctuate, fracture, hutchcraft, inchcape,\n&gt;=\r\n  ineffectual, infrastructure, intellectual, juncture,\n&gt;  latchkey, lecture=\r\n, manufacture, picture, prefecture,\n&gt;  punctuate, puncture, sanctuary, stri=\r\ncture, structure,\n&gt;  tincture, witchcraft.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Source: &lt;http://www.speech.=\r\ncs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  See\n&gt;  &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMU_P=\r\nronouncing_Dictionary&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  19.12.2007 Benct Philip Jonsson &lt;mailto:bpj@mel=\r\nroch.se&gt;\n&gt;  }\n&gt;  \n\n"
