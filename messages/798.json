I think \nof junior as being for beginners while they are still getting used to \nthe alphabet.  I find that senior makes more distinctive word shapes, \nwhich are easier to remember without the necessity of &quot;sounding the \nletters out,&quot; i.e. sight recognition is improved, and it may even may \nmake reading faster to those adept in senior.\n\nI see the distinction between senior and junior as similar to that of \nprinted T.O. and cursive T.O.  In the past, cursive was not practical to \nuse for printed material so almost everything was printed in \ndisconnected letters.  Cursive writing was reserved for handwriting.  \nBut that is no longer necessary.  Computer technology should be able to \nmake the use of senior forms relatively easy, so why should we not use \nthe senior form in material printed for proficient readers? \n\nIt is my understanding that Arabic letters change their shape depending \non their location in a word without causing distress to Arabic readers.  \nShould not QS have the flexibility to use the senior forms in printed \nmaterial if the writer prefers it?  The senior forms are  more fluid and \naesthetically appealing to me than the junior version of the alphabet.\n\nPaige\n\nPh.D. wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Del Ray skribis:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dr-o Phil kaj Tim:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t imagine that anyone seriously thinks that QS\n&gt; &gt; might supplant Latin for writing English.
