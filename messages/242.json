The book starts out as a<br/>\nnormal text and as you read on more and more characters are replaced by the<br/>\nShavian equivalents.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing this for English is also possible. Just take a piece of text of<br/>\nreasonable size, and gradually replace the letters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will be harder to do, because many English words have letters that are<br/>\nnot pronounced.
