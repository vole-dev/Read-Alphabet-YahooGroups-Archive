Therefore, I am changing the subject,<br/>\n&gt; and new posts about this topic should be under this subject line:<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Newsletter.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) There is the problem of posting in QS to Yahoo groups, which seems<br/>\n&gt; somewhat problematical due to difficulties that different browsers have<br/>\n&gt; in displaying a QS font. I am not that knowledgeable about what causes<br/>\n&gt; these problems, but it has been evident that some browsers have more<br/>\n&gt; problems than others. Has anyone tested this? If so, do you know which<br/>\n&gt; browsers work the best? Besides the idea of a newsletter, if we could<br/>\n&gt; post more messages in QS, I am confident it would help everyone&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; reading ability. There is an indisputable irony that on a site devoted<br/>\n&gt; to the spread and use of an improved English alphabet, the peculiarities<br/>\n&gt; of the internet as it has developed has insured that we continue to<br/>\n&gt; write in TO almost exclusively.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) I would expect that a newsletter would be uploaded to the<br/>\n&gt; Read_Alphabet site where it would remain available for future download.<br/>\n&gt; However, I wonder if there is a practical way to distribute a newsletter<br/>\n&gt; more broadly? Should a download of a newsletter include a copy of the<br/>\n&gt; alphabet with truncated rules for use? Or should a copy of the alphabet<br/>\n&gt; be positioned next to the newsletter download so that those needing a<br/>\n&gt; copy can easily obtain it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3) What program should be used to produce a newsletter. And what<br/>\n&gt; program would a person need to be able to open it? Should it contain<br/>\n&gt; just printed news, or should photos with QS captions be included along<br/>\n&gt; with other features.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4) How much material should a newsletter contain and how frequently<br/>\n&gt; should it be produced? If we produce material on a regular basis, we<br/>\n&gt; might expect that people would become more interested if they saw text<br/>\n&gt; in the alphabet to read. How can we expect to interest people in the<br/>\n&gt; alphabet if there is virtually nothing to read in it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 5) Just as in the open source paradigm, many people cooperate to<br/>\n&gt; produce products that rival corporate offerings, if several of us work<br/>\n&gt; together, we should be able to produce a newsletter that would be<br/>\n&gt; interesting for QS aficionados to read.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 6) What topics should be covered? As someone else wrote, I would think<br/>\n&gt; that general interest stories would be best as there would not be enough<br/>\n&gt; news about QS to produce a newsletter on any regular basis.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 7) Copy for a newsletter cannot violate copyright laws.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 8) This is farther afield, but it just popped into my head. I assume<br/>\n&gt; that a QS crossword puzzle in a newsletter should work fine, but TO<br/>\n&gt; puzzles are based on a &quot;proper&quot; spelling. Since words spelled in QS are<br/>\n&gt; based on the writer&#39;s pronunciation, an unusual pronunciation might make<br/>\n&gt; the puzzle harder. Of course, that could be considered part of the<br/>\n&gt; difficulty of the puzzle. It could mean that it would help to know<br/>\n&gt; where the puzzle-maker hails from. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Obviously, I am proficient about thinking up questions. Anyone have any<br/>\n&gt; answers or any other questions they would like to pose? Anyone is<br/>\n&gt; welcome to start their own thread under this general one about a<br/>\n&gt; newsletter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Paige<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
