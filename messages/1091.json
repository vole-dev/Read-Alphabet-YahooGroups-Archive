I did not get a chance to \nfinish the response, and the font is not available here since it is off \nthe server now.\n\nThe designer of a font has the right to name the font.  You might want \nto use a name that doesn&#39;t include &quot;Shaw&quot; however, since that might lead \npeople to expect it to be a Shavian font rather than a QS one.  But that \nis up to you.\n\nI think the font looks great.  I am especially pleased to see &quot;E-at&quot; \nlooking right.  I know it may seem petty, but Bartok&#39;s font really \nannoyed me every time I used it because of that discrepancy.  You opened \nup the left side of the letter which should make it easier to read and \ndistinguish, especially in smaller fonts.  In John Zuk&#39;s font, the left \nside of the letter was just too close to the right side.  [Jerome let us \nuse half-letters, which was good, but there were technical problems with \nthe font, which were never corrected.  When writing in it, at times the \ncursor would not appear in the place where it really was so it made it \nvery difficult to type.  This may have been a kerning problem, but I&#39;m \nreally not sure.  Also, he produced this font pretty quickly, and some \nof the letters are not as well formed as I would like.  After Jerome, \nothers designed &quot;junior&quot; fonts.  This was probably partially due to the \ndifficulties Zuk encountered and because you don&#39;t have to enable the \nhalf letters to print correctly.]\n\nI believe Kingsley has some or maybe all of the half letters available.  \nThat would be nice if you could get that to work properly.  But a \n&quot;junior&quot; font where all the glyphs look correct and print properly would \nbe excellent.  I am wondering if your font will leave spaces between \nadjacent letters, or would it appear to have some of the cursive quality \nas in handwritten senior QS?\n\nTrying to remember my other comments...\n\n   1. Your font seems to be missing the &quot;wh&quot; sound, which many of us use\n      when we write because we pronounce the words that way. (I say\n      seems because of the rectangular boxes, one of which could have\n      had the &quot;wh&quot; glyph for all I know.)  It is simply the &quot;w&quot; symbol\n      with a hook at the bottom so it should be easy to add to the\n      font.  To me &quot;which&quot; and &quot;witch&quot; are not pronounced the same. \n      People who use this sound find it annoying if the font doesn&#39;t\n      include it.  By the way, adding &quot;wh&quot; was one of the changes Read\n      made in going from the Shaw alphabet to QS.\n   2. When I opened the font, in several places there were rectangular\n      boxes.  I wasn&#39;t sure if some of these may have been glyphs not\n      displaying correctly. (I didn&#39;t have a chance to check to see if\n      all the symbols were present.)\n   3. The font should have a naming dot.  I don&#39;t remember seeing one.\n   4. The font should have angled brackets to use in the place of\n      standard parentheses.\n\nRegarding schwa + &quot;r.&quot;  That is the vowel + &quot;r&quot; combination for &quot;bird.&quot; \nThe vowel in &quot;bard&quot; should be no. 32 &quot;A-h&quot; + &quot;r.&quot;\n\nI hope this helps.  Thanks again for your work. \n\nPaige\n\nPaul Tremblay wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; No. It should not look like a &quot;D&quot;..
