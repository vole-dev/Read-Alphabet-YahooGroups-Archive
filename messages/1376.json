You stated you can&#39;t hear the difference <br/>\nbetween the two words.  I am not sure what that means.  Is that just <br/>\nanother way of saying you pronounce them the same?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, can you hear the difference between &quot;hair&quot; and &quot;here&quot;?  For <br/>\nme these words rhyme with the bear - beer example.  Do you pronounces <br/>\nhair and here the same?  And if you hear the vowel difference between <br/>\nhair and here, then you must be able to hear the vowel difference <br/>\nbetween bear and beer even if you don&#39;t make the distinction yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last question.  I don&#39;t remember you saying how you pronounced.bear <br/>\nand beer other than the same.  Do you pronounce &quot;bear&quot; like &quot;beer&quot; or is <br/>\nit the other way round?<br/>\n<br/>\nPaige</div>",
