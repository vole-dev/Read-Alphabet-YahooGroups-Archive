  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1935521020\">Hello Paul<br><br>Thanks for your well thought out reply.<br><br>Yes, I do write in QS and have done for 40 odd years, including corresponding with KR for 4 or 5 years. &nbsp;I also stayed with him in his lovely cottage in&nbsp;Abbots Morton during which time we spoke a lot about the theory&nbsp;and&nbsp;practice behind&nbsp;QS. \n<br><br>His stated intention in designing QS was to move away from the prescriptive nature of Shaw&#39;s phonetic alphabet and more towards a usable alphabet in the real world. &nbsp;<br><br>The&nbsp;following&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;extract&nbsp;from&nbsp;&quot;Sound&nbsp;Writing&quot;&nbsp;-&nbsp;an&nbsp;introduction&nbsp;to&nbsp;an&nbsp;exhibition&nbsp;at&nbsp;Reading&nbsp;University&nbsp;in&nbsp;1972&nbsp;(which&nbsp;I&nbsp;will&nbsp;\n<br>put&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;files&nbsp;section&nbsp;when&nbsp;I&nbsp;can&nbsp;produce&nbsp;a&nbsp;version&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;less&nbsp;than&nbsp;5MB):<br>  <br>&quot;..... I accepted the task <i>[Shavian correspondence group] </i>with an entirely free hand, for it was possible that minor problems , unforeseeable by theory, might emerge from the alphabet&#39;s uses by persons of all sorts, ages and dialects. A \n<i>Guide to Shavian Spellings</i>&nbsp;was prepared and I awaited results. &nbsp;Experience thus gained, being largely techbnical, is detailed eslewhere. &nbsp;Enough to say that Londoners, Scots, Americans, while raw beginners, regarded their personal speech as \n<i>the</i>&nbsp;&#39;proper&#39; English, but were contentedly conforming in a matter of weeks to the printed spellings of <i>Androcles</i> and the journal <i>Shaw-Script; </i>for a ready conformity saves thought and meets readers&#39; expectations.&quot;\n<br><br>In my experience of the QS correspondence group, which continued from 1967 to 1972, successor to the Shavian group, while it was confined to users in the British Isles, it did encompass two distinctly different accents - that of southern England and that of Belfast in N Ireland. There was no difficulty either in conforming to Read&#39;s simple rules, nor in legibility or readability. &nbsp;I did have brief correspondence with users in New Zealand and USA during that time and had no difficulty in &quot;hearing&quot; their local accents despite their use of standard spellings per QM.\n<br><br>I accept that there may be a case for adapting some of the rules to a country - for example the use of terminal #27 E-at instead of Read&#39;s (and my usage) of terminal #26 I-t (I have somehow got used to seeing that now as most of my correspondents come from N America). &nbsp;I am however convinced that some \n<i>rules</i>&nbsp;need to be enforced in order to achieve easy readability across international boundaries.<br><br>I know that this discussion has gone way beyond these simple points, and I have been following it with interest, though, due to my lack of internet connection for most of the past 40 days, it has been hard to keep up with, and read fully, all the arguments put forward. &nbsp;I guess the discussion has a way to go yet.\n<br><br>with kind regards<br><br>Moira<br><br><div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1935521020gmail_quote\">On 31/10/2007, <b class=\"ygrps-yiv-1935521020gmail_sendername\">Paul Tremblay</b> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:phthenry@...\">\nphthenry@...</a>&gt; wrote:</span><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-1935521020gmail_quote\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-right:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;margin-left:0.80ex;border-left-color:#cccccc;border-left-width:1px;border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n<div style=\"background-color:#ffffff;\"><div style=\"width:655px;\"><div style=\"width:490px;padding-top:0;padding-right:15px;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0;float:left;\"><div><p><span>Moira O&#39;Brien wrote: <br> &gt; \n<br> &gt; <br> &gt; IMHO<br> &gt; <br> &gt; As a southern England English speaker I pronounce Air and Ear one way<br> &gt;  (and very similar to the way KR pronounced them).  Others from <br> &gt; across the Atlantic pronounce them another way.  Our cousins in South \n<br> &gt;  Africa and Australia other ways again.  And so on throughout the <br> &gt; English speaking world.  We all understand the sounds that we see <br> &gt; written and we hear them in our own voice.<br> &gt; <br> &gt; From this point of view, I am wholly at one with KR in his use of  \n<br> &gt; &quot;words&quot; to describe the sounds of the different glyphs.  It allows <br> &gt; all of us<br> &gt; <br> &gt; to use our own language to interpret the written word.<br> &gt; <br> &gt; Just becuase one regional accent does not distinguish between certain \n<br> &gt;  vowels which other regional accents do, does not make either one <br> &gt; right or wrong.<br> &gt; <br><br></span> Hi Moira,<br><br> Do you all write in QS? That&#39;s pretty neat if you do!<br><br> I think you are not understanding my proposal. \n<br><br> First, I think Kingsely Read&#39;s methods of describing the sounds of words<br> by using other words is confusing and not very helpful. He pronounced<br> words one way, but we all pronounce them differently. If I am correct, \n<br> he thought that all of his words would be adequate representations of<br> the sounds he meant by his letter, but he was very wrong here. Try to<br> understand the confusion this creates, especially for beginners. At the  \n<br> same time, I don&#39;t think Read wanted one letter to serve for different <br> sounds. I believe he wanted the opposite: one letter equals one and only <br> one sound. There was already a system where one letter could represent  \n<br> more than one sound, traditional orthography (that is, normal writing), <br> and Read rejected this system. The whole foundation of QS is based on <br> one sound per letter.<br><br> I am not proscribing that one dialect is superior to the other, or that  \n<br> one should have to write QS in a standard dialect. Quite the opposite. I <br>   am trying to make QS more precise so that dialects can be expressed <br> accurately.<br><br> Right now, the sounds are not expressed clearly. I want the sounds  \n<br> described in a precise way. That way, when I use #34 (for example), I <br> know exactly what sound I am writing, and a reader of my writing to <br> understand exactly what I mean.<br><br> The IPA would give us a very precise way to show how each letter should  \n<br> sound. For those who don&#39;t have any linguistics background, I have <br> proposed that we give much fuller, linguist-*like_ descriptions of the <br> letters, and Anthony Grahn has agreed to making such a chart.
