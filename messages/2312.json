When I saw the Shaw Alphabet for the first time back on April 16th, 2002, I thought it was one of the most beautiful writing systems I&#39;d ever seen, so much so that 2 days later I became determined to do something about it when I found out that it was the only book published in the alphabet. Quikskript... not so much. I read through the QuikSkript guide and ended up with more questions than answers. I found it really confusing and there appeared to be many instances where things that look identical could be pronounced differently. For example, Read said that you could use the ng character to represent the suffix -ing. For example, would Commander Data&#39;s creator be Noonien Soong, or Noonien Suing? In the Shaw Alphabet it&#39;s obvious, but in the Read Alphabet you can never be sure. I have the same basic issue with Paul Vandenbrink&#39;s &quot;Shaw Alphabet&quot; in how he merged ALL of the\n vowels into<br>\n&gt;  2-3 characters, so good luck trying to read a story about the 5 sisters Jane, Jan, Jen, Joan, June and their brother John. Wow, I hope that I didn&#39;t just completely alienate this group as potential customers with this message...<br>\n&gt; &gt;<br>\n&gt; &gt;<br>\n&gt; &gt; <br>\n&gt; &gt;<br>\n&gt; &gt;<br>\n&gt;<br>\n<br>\n</div>\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div><br><br> </div> </div> </blockquote></span></blockquote></div>   </div></html></div>",

I would be curious to know why you rejected \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Quiks=\r\nkript for Shaws. Or, could you send me a website where I \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; could see w=\r\nhy others retained Shaw over Read&#39;s alphabet?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Well, I just prefer =\r\nthe look and feel of the original over the new one. When I saw the Shaw Alp=\r\nhabet for the first time back on April 16th, 2002, I thought it was one of =\r\nthe most beautiful writing systems I&#39;d ever seen, so much so that 2 days la=\r\nter I became determined to do something about it when I found out that it w=\r\nas the only book published in the alphabet. Quikskript... not so much. I re=\r\nad through the QuikSkript guide and ended up with more questions than answe=\r\nrs. I found it really confusing and there appeared to be many instances whe=\r\nre things that look identical could be pronounced differently. For example,=\r\n Read said that you could use the ng character to represent the suffix -ing=\r\n. For example, would Commander Data&#39;s creator be Noonien Soong, or Noonien =\r\nSuing? In the Shaw Alphabet it&#39;s obvious, but in the Read Alphabet you can =\r\nnever be sure. I have the same basic issue with Paul Vandenbrink&#39;s &quot;Shaw Al=\r\nphabet&quot; in how he merged ALL of the vowels\n into\n&gt;&gt;  2-3 characters, so goo=\r\nd luck trying to read a story about the 5 sisters Jane, Jan, Jen, Joan, Jun=\r\ne and their brother John. Wow, I hope that I didn&#39;t just completely alienat=\r\ne this group as potential customers with this message...\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;

But I must sa=\r\ny that QS seems, to me, far easier to read and write.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEven Read st=\r\nated he went back to revise what didn&#39;t work with Shavian, and I feel that =\r\nQS addressed many of the flaws of the original Shavian (which probably expl=\r\nains why Quickstript is sometimes referred to Shavian 2. Although I feel ca=\r\nlling it Quickscript Shavian is fair tribute to both the scripts originator=\r\ns).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nQS is designed to be more fluid in writing, and has many more =\r\nligatures. In fact, there is even ligature shortening. At first this confus=\r\ned me, but as I became accustomed to it I realized it made much more sense =\r\nto do this.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOver all, QS is so well designed that when I went back=\r\n to original Shavian I realized how rough it really was. It makes sense tho=\r\nugh, since Read basically IMPROVED the original Shavian template.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nI believe that QS could be adopted by English users far easier than Shavian=\r\n for numerous reasons. It shares a lot in common with Japanese Kana forms a=\r\ns well as Korean in terms of writability and readibility. It is much easier=\r\n to write. The shorting of ing using ng and the ligatures and half hooks ma=\r\nke it easier to read and write. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBeing left handed I noticed somet=\r\nhing else about QS that is amazing. The left to right strokes, which Read s=\r\nays are preferable whenever a letter can be written two ways, makes the wri=\r\ntten form of QS extremely easy for lefties like me to pick up.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSha=\r\nvian, although a beautiful script, is not designed for lefties and gives me=\r\n too much resistance when writing.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnyway, those are just a few of=\r\n my thoughts.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSincerely,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTristan Vick&lt;br&gt;\nHave a Happy Ne=\r\nw Year everyone!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:Read=\r\n_Alphabet%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:Read_Alphabet=\r\n%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Sid Tanaban &lt;sidb=\r\nan2@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I couldn&#39;t read anything - even the fo=\r\nnts.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;___________________________=\r\n_____&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Tim &lt;rubik67@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:Read_Alphabet%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;=\r\n_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:Read_Alphabet%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;Read_Alphabet@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Monday, December 31, 2012 11:10 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;Subject: [Read_Alphabet] Re: Shaw Alphabet Books is now online.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- In &lt;a=\r\n rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:Read_Alphabet%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:Read_Alphabet%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;Read_Alphabet@y=\r\nahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Sid Tanaban &lt;sidban2@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; A happy new year to you, Tim!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;And t=\r\no you.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I went to your book on Poe and Shaw =\r\nbut it was too black to read &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; anything about your new boo=\r\nk. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Interesting.
