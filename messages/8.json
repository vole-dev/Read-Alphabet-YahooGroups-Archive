I&#39;m redesigning the Jerome font with corrections to the=\r\n shapes of some letters, and the whole font will be larger.  I&#39;m testing ev=\r\nery letter as I go along to insure readability at every step in the 10-14 p=\r\noint range.  To me it seems all the Shavian fonts developed so far have bee=\r\nn difficult when used at the same point size as a Roman type.\n\nPaige has su=\r\nggested that QM (the Quickscript Manual) be given higher priority than CFPB=\r\n.  I quite agree.\n\nAbout the Tall and Deep X suggested in QM, page, I earli=\r\ner stated that they weren&#39;t found in any of the writing samples, but I was =\r\nwrong, there is a Tall X on the last line of page 25.  Paige has stated tha=\r\nt he doesn&#39;t use the X forms, and considers them unnecessary, but I think s=\r\nome might find them a convenience in handwriting.  As long as we agree that=\r\n a Quickscript/Second Shaw Alphabet font should enable as much as possible,=\r\n all of the potentials of &quot;Senior Quickscript,&quot; I&#39;m leaning to the idea tha=\r\nt they should also be present as alternative letterforms for use.  Everythi=\r\nng except the basic letters will probably not be used in computer typing ex=\r\ncept for signatures, graphic design, and for experienced Quickscriptists to=\r\n show off. :-)  But their presence is available to all who want to give a c=\r\nalligraphic design, etc.  So if the half-letters, why not Read&#39;s X&#39;s?  Use =\r\nof it will be entirely optional.\n\nRoger, how about you?  I&#39;d REALLY appreci=\r\nate your input here.\n\nPaige suggested the possibility of extending the half=\r\n-letters to include a half-Yea, and a half-Whitewheat.  A few thoughts to k=\r\neep in mind:  \n1. We are talking about a modification of Read&#39;s work, but o=\r\nn the other hand,\n2. Alphabets do belong to their users, and do change over=\r\n time.\n3. the computer can easily handle the tall half-letters, so a half-Y=\r\nea will pose no problem at all to create or use.\n4. Kerning (spacing betwee=\r\nn letters) creates some minor problems with the half-Win-win.  Because it n=\r\needs to align not beside, but directly beneath the appropriate vowel letter=\r\n, after it&#39;s typed (in Windows, at least) the cursor begins to appear to th=\r\ne right  of where the insertion point actually is, which can make correctio=\r\nns very tricky.  This error increases every time the half-W is used.  Never=\r\ntheless, it&#39;s a really cool effect, and no one can deprive me of the right =\r\nto write KDld I like it!  But it works better if it&#39;s the very last thing t=\r\nyped or converted (which it was in this e-mail.)  \n5. The same problems whi=\r\nch apply to Half-Win/win, will also apply to a half-Whitewheat.  \n6. In typ=\r\nical text font sizes, 10-12, a  half-Whitewheat will almost certainly be si=\r\nmilar enough toa half-Deed to cause confusion.\n\nWith those thoughts in mind=\r\n, I&#39;m very open to the possibility of creating a half-YEA, especially if th=\r\nere&#39;s another vote in favor, but I&#39;m inclined to think a half-Whitewheat is=\r\nn&#39;t that beneficial an expansion.  (Some of us will NEVER use it anyway, we=\r\n just don&#39;t say it.  CFPB, for what it&#39;s worth, dropped it too.)  \n\nOne oth=\r\ner item.  Read goes beyond developing Quickscript as a reform of the Shaw a=\r\nlphabet, to a de facto shorthand system, with literally dozens of abbreviat=\r\nions on page 17 of QM.  To me, these feel like they&#39;re leaving the realm of=\r\n alphabet (symbols for sound) far behind, and are starting getting to get i=\r\nnto the realm of shorthand, which is more appropriate for people to use in =\r\nstrictly personal correspondence only.  \n\nHowever, I do feel the abbreviati=\r\nons on QM, page 12, in the &quot;Junior Quickscript&quot; section, are very useful.  =\r\nThey increase the one-letter abbreviations from four to eight, their meanin=\r\ng is self-evident in context, they&#39;re re-iterated in CFPB, and they were al=\r\nl anticipated explicitly in the preface to Androcles and the Lion.  One col=\r\numn of the proposal is &quot;one-letter abbreviations&quot;;  I suggest we limit the =\r\nclarified presentation of the Second Shaw alphabet to those 8 one-letter ab=\r\nbreviations, rather than open a Pandora&#39;s box of &quot;shorthand tips.&quot;  Anyone =\r\nelse&#39;s thoughts on this? \n\nSO tYk tM mI, mF frendL!\n\n---\nShalom v&#39;Tovah,\nJo=\r\nn Zuck\nWeb URL: http://surf.to/frimmin\n\nIt is more important to love much t=\r\nhan to think much.\nAlways do that which most impels you to love.\n          =\r\n                            --St. Teresa of Avila\n----- Original Message --=\r\n--- \nFrom: &quot;Jon Zuck&quot; &lt;frimmin@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;Read_Alphabet@egroups.com&gt;\nSe=\r\nnt: Friday, December 01, 2000 6:46 PM\nSubject: Re: [Read_Alphabet] Awl\n\n\n&gt; =\r\nOh, yeah, &quot;Valve&quot; is definitely on the shelf.

We are talking about a modification of=\r\n Read&#39;s work, but on the other \nhand,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;2. Alphabets do belong to =\r\ntheir users, and do change over time.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;3. the computer can easily=\r\n handle the tall half-letters, so a half-Yea will \npose no problem at all&n=\r\nbsp;to create or use.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;4. Kerning (spacing between letters) creat=\r\nes some minor problems with the \nhalf-Win-win.&nbsp; Because it needs to al=\r\nign&nbsp;not beside, but \ndirectly&nbsp;beneath the appropriate vowel lette=\r\nr, after it&#39;s typed (in \nWindows, at least) the cursor begins to appear &lt;ST=\r\nRONG&gt;to the \nright&lt;/STRONG&gt;&nbsp; of where the insertion point actually is,=\r\n which can make \ncorrections very tricky.&nbsp; This error increases every =\r\ntime the half-W is \nused.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it&#39;s a really cool effect, an=\r\nd no one can deprive me \nof the right to write &lt;FONT face=3DJerome&gt;&lt;FONT si=\r\nze=3D4&gt;KDl&lt;/FONT&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt; I like \nit!&nbsp; But it works better if it&#39;s the=\r\n very last thing typed or \nconverted&nbsp;(which it was in this e-mail.)&nb=\r\nsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;5. The same problems which apply to Half-Win/win, will also=\r\n apply to a \nhalf-Whitewheat.&nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;6. In typical text font siz=\r\nes, 10-12, a&nbsp; half-Whitewheat will almost \ncertainly be similar enough=\r\n toa half-Deed to cause confusion.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;With those =\r\nthoughts in mind, I&#39;m&nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;very&lt;/STRONG&gt; open to the \npossibility o=\r\nf creating a half-YEA, especially if there&#39;s another vote in favor, \nbut I&#39;=\r\nm inclined to think a half-Whitewheat isn&#39;t that beneficial an \nexpansion.&=\r\nnbsp; (Some of us will NEVER use it anyway, we just don&#39;t say \nit.&nbsp; CF=\r\nPB, for what it&#39;s worth, dropped it too.)&nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;One other item.&nbsp; Read goes beyond developing Quickscript as a refor=\r\nm \nof the Shaw&nbsp;alphabet, to a de facto shorthand system, with literall=\r\ny dozens \nof abbreviations on page 17 of QM.&nbsp; To me, these feel like t=\r\nhey&#39;re leaving \nthe realm of alphabet (symbols for sound) far behind, and a=\r\nre starting getting \nto get into the realm of shorthand, which is&nbsp;more=\r\n appropriate for people to \nuse in strictly personal correspondence only.&n=\r\nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;However, I do feel the abbreviations on =\r\nQM,&nbsp;page 12, in the &quot;Junior \nQuickscript&quot; section, are very useful.&nb=\r\nsp; They increase the one-letter \nabbreviations from four to eight, their m=\r\neaning is self-evident in context, \nthey&#39;re re-iterated in CFPB, and they w=\r\nere &lt;STRONG&gt;all &lt;/STRONG&gt;anticipated \nexplicitly in the preface to &lt;EM&gt;Andr=\r\nocles and the Lion.&nbsp; &lt;/EM&gt;One column \nof&nbsp;the proposal is &quot;one-let=\r\nter abbreviations&quot;;&nbsp; I suggest \nwe&nbsp;limit&nbsp;the&nbsp;clarified =\r\npresentation of the Second Shaw alphabet \nto those 8 one-letter&nbsp;abbrev=\r\niations, rather than open a&nbsp;Pandora&#39;s box \nof &quot;shorthand tips.&quot;&nbsp;
