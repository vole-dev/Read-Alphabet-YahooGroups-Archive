  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-271745983\">That is excellent news and this maybe beside the point but I did<br/>\njust want to point out that there are more variations to characters<br/>\nthan those listed in the proposal and that some characters have more<br/>\nthan one variation. Thus it seems that the variants listed are<br/>\nincomplete and the selector to toggle between the standard and one<br/>\n_single_ variant is not enough to work with Senior. As it stands the<br/>\nproposal is much needed and wonderfully complete for Junior QS it&#39;s<br/>\njust that it would have to be expanded for Senior. <br/>\n  I absolutely revel in the idea of having our own Unicode range as<br/>\nsoon as possible. I just want to make sure we are able  to get enough<br/>\nslots for Senior. But I certainly don&#39;t have any expertise in writing<br/>\nUnicode proposals and for all I know changing the proposal for Senior<br/>\nlatter is perfectly simple.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  If interested, here are a few rather dull observations to support my<br/>\nclaim:<br/>\n<br/>\n  As we know, it turns out that in Senior QS, there are far more<br/>\nvariations to letters implied in Read&#39;s Quickscript Manual (QM) than<br/>\nare explicitly mentioned in that book. For example:<br/>\n- For each half letter glyph, there must be a step variation as well<br/>\nas a non-step variation. This already implies a normal form plus 2<br/>\nvariations for at least 4 letters.<br/>\n- The glyph See that joins a following glyph Tea can not be the same<br/>\nas a glyph See that joins a following Pea. (One sees both the ST and<br/>\nSP joins in the manual but explicit mention of the variation is not<br/>\nmade.) Quite simply there would be no way to write both &quot;stop&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;spot&quot; correctly without addition variations no mater what rendering<br/>\nengine is used.<br/>\n- The Roe + Ice (eg &quot;pry&quot;) must involve different glyphs than Ice +<br/>\nRoe (eg &quot;mire&quot;)<br/>\n- The At + May in &quot;am&quot; vs the May + Ice in &quot;my&quot; <br/>\n- The See and Utter glyphs in &quot;some&quot; vs the See and Utter used in<br/>\nother words.<br/>\n- The possible permutations of these variations<br/>\n- There are more but I won&#39;t bore you. It would be nice to make a<br/>\ncomprehensive list and I will be very happy to contribute.
