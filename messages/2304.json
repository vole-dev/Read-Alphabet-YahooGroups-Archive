  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1526106783\">Check out the latest update at www.shawalphabetbooks.com for a direct link. I dare ANYONE to say that they can&#39;t see the content on the page now. :-) I got the Original version published at 6:14:02pm and the Condensed version published at 7:00:21pm, with the final updates to the home page done and uploaded at 9:48:02pm, making the 50th anniversary (barely) with about 2 hours and 12 minutes to spare. :-) It is somewhat bittersweet, though. When I attempted to launch the original book for the retail market, Lulu hacked and slashed the profit margin down to 37 cents (from a $36.99 cover price), making a per sale margin for me of only 1%. :-( Quite frankly, I didn&#39;t spend nearly 11 years and a quarter of my life working on this to get a piddling little income like that. So, for now, they&#39;re ONLY being made available at Lulu.com (direct links from my home page, which I STRONGLY suggest checking out, or by doing a search for &quot;Poe Meets Shaw&quot; at Lulu) until I can find out if there&#39;s any way for them to scale back on the retailer&#39;s profit margin. Even if I ramped the price up to $49.99, the profit would only work out to be $5.77, and I really don&#39;t want to do that. Basically, either there&#39;s a way to reduce the retailer&#39;s take or I&#39;ll need to spend at least another month doing a retool on the book to get the page count down, and thus the cost, while maintaining all of the original content. Bottom line, this may be a VERY limited first edition, depending on what sort of response I get from Lulu support.</div>",
