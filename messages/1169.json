They are simply easy and quick ways to write these \nvowels that combine with &quot;r.&quot;\n\nAnd hearing someone&#39;s accent is cool if if it is not 100% correct or as \nexact as an IPA transcription.\n\nFinding it funny that there are two letters you don&#39;t use is like \nthinking it funny that the British pronounce words differently than \nAmericans do.  A well designed alphabet should be able to map the major \ndialects of all the speakers of the language should it not?  Many \nEnglish speakers no longer use the &quot;hw&quot; sound, but for those of us who \ndo, a suggestion that it should be excluded from the alphabet will fall \non deaf ears.\n\nI must ask one question since you brought it up.  I understand that you \nsubstitute the vowel sound of &quot;Ah&quot; in place of the traditional &quot;Awe&quot; \ntypically represented by &quot;au,&quot; as in &quot;nautical.&quot;  I first became really \naware of this when a TV announcer in a frequently-aired commercial said \n&quot;nautical&quot; as if it were spelled &quot;knotical,&quot; which left me confused as I \ndid not understand why someone would pronounce a word whose spelling \nclearly seemed - at least to me - to indicate it was a diphthong as a \nshort o sound.  What I am wondering is how do you pronounce the word \n&quot;awe&quot; itself as in what one experiences in connection with the deity?  \nDoes that also come out as &quot;ah&quot;?  I have difficulty imagining someone \nsaying, &quot;I stand in ah before God.&quot;  To me that is the sound the doctor \ntells you to make before using a tongue depressor, not a separate word \nby itself.\n\nI know this probably sounds parochial, but I have never had anyone \nanswer this question before.  And if, in fact, people whose dialect has \nundergone this merger still pronounce the word &quot;awe&quot; as a stand-alone \ndiphthong, why would they eschew it in other settings, such as \n&quot;nautical.&quot;  The answer, I would suspect, is that English orthography is \nso hopelessly messed up that it causes no cognitive dissonance to \npronounce the same letters one way in one word and quite differently in \nother words.
