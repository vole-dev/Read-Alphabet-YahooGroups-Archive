If you&#39;re having trouble getting it=\r\n to work right, don&#39;t hesitate to ask on the list. Similarly, if you&#39;re hav=\r\ning trouble getting Quikscript to work OK in whatever you&#39;re doing, ask on =\r\nthe list. Making QS less annoying to use on the computer will help adoption=\r\n, but I don&#39;t know where the usual pain points are, especially for Windows =\r\nusers who aren&#39;t computer nerds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thank you for hel=\r\nping us help you help us all,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot; styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;white-space:pre&quot;&gt;\t&lt;/span&gt;Nathan&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On J=\r\nul 1, 2013, at 12:23 PM, HeyMister &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:booth.g@...&quot;=\r\n&gt;booth.g@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div d=\r\nir=3D&quot;auto&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; font-style:=\r\n normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal;=\r\n line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0p=\r\nx; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;=\r\n -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; &quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;And=\r\n now I know why the group is dead.
