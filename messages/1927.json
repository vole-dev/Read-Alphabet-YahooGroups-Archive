But please, it&#39;s going to be difficult enough<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; to set this standard. Let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  To design an ASCII transcription of any script which is not<br/>\n&gt;  isomorphic with the 26-letter, two-case Roman alphabet --<br/>\n&gt;  and I&#39;ve been doing that a couple of times, for Devanagari,<br/>\n&gt;  Tibetan, Avestan, IPA and most recently QS -- is a lot like<br/>\n&gt;  solving Rubik&#39;s cube, in that all pairings you make between<br/>\n&gt;  characters of the two sets make other pairings possible or<br/>\n&gt;  impossible. So rather than getting ahead of ourselves we&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;  spare ourselves trouble at a later time by considering all<br/>\n&gt;  of Senior QS from the outset.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Suppose we had decided that we need to consider only Junior<br/>\n&gt;  QS, excluding both alternate forms of #23 and #36 and half-<br/>\n&gt;  letters we would cheerfully have mapped {N} to #21 and not<br/>\n&gt;  even reflected that it is better to map it to alternate #23<br/>\n&gt;  and that {G} is a reasonable mapping for #21. In the same<br/>\n&gt;  way, if we don&#39;t consider the entire character set of Senior<br/>\n&gt;  QS from the outset we must map what we left out -- the half-<br/>\n&gt;  letters -- to the rubble left over from the first round of<br/>\n&gt;  mappings. We would e.g. totally miss that {J} is a<br/>\n&gt;  reasonable mapping for #14, leaving us free to map {Z} to<br/>\n&gt;  half-z (#12.5), totally analogous to the case with {G} for<br/>\n&gt;  #21 and {N} for alternate #23 (#23.2). Likewise if I had not<br/>\n&gt;  considered the half-letters from the outset I would have<br/>\n&gt;  found {H} with the memory cue &quot;How&quot; a jolly good mapping for<br/>\n&gt;  #37, disregarding that {B} is a reasonable mapping on the<br/>\n&gt;  grounds that<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - the memory cue &quot;Bout&quot; consists of the letter _B_ plus<br/>\n&gt;  the name Read gave to this letter, - _B_ in TO stands<br/>\n&gt;  for a labial sound /b/ and #37 may be considered to end<br/>\n&gt;  in another labial sound /w/,<br/>\n&gt;  - it recalls the Greek ligature for the digraph OU,<br/>\n&gt;  which in turn recalls the normal spelling for #37 in<br/>\n&gt;  English TO.<br/>\n&gt;  - it leaves {H} free to be mapped to half-h (#19.5), for<br/>\n&gt;  which one otherwise would have been forced to choose<br/>\n&gt;  between mappings that were all essentially<br/>\n&gt;  unsatisfactory.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Naturally the experience of coming up with half-letter<br/>\n&gt;  mappings for QS- SAMPA was helpful in coming to the<br/>\n&gt;  conclusion that the full Senior QS including the half-<br/>\n&gt;  letters must be considered from the outset in order not to<br/>\n&gt;  be forced into haphazard mappings for left-overs. In fact I<br/>\n&gt;  think that I in BPJ2 have found reasonable mappings for all<br/>\n&gt;  the letter forms sanctioned by QM save one: half-d (#4.5)<br/>\n&gt;  and {R} were simply the odd men out, but even for them I<br/>\n&gt;  was able to find an albeit far-fetched memory cue, namely<br/>\n&gt;  that American /d/ (and /t/, which usually is merged with<br/>\n&gt;  /d/ in this position: _good at, get it_) between vowels<br/>\n&gt;  sounds like a kind of _r_ to speakers of some accents of<br/>\n&gt;  English and many foreign languages. In old British movies<br/>\n&gt;  even RP speakers can be heard using a sound of this kind<br/>\n&gt;  for the /r/ in words like _very, worry, carry_. This is not<br/>\n&gt;  to say that BPJ2 is the only possible alternative if one<br/>\n&gt;  wants to find satisfactory mappings for the half- letters<br/>\n&gt;  -- it clearly isn&#39;t --, but only to say that the mappings<br/>\n&gt;  for the half-letters would have been much more random, and<br/>\n&gt;  hence unsatisfactory, if they had not been considered from<br/>\n&gt;  the outset.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I would really like to hear what native speakers think of<br/>\n&gt;  the mapping of #14 to {J}. All cases of TO _j_ (or _g_)<br/>\n&gt;  corrsponding to #14, and all words where there is variation<br/>\n&gt;  between the sounds of #14 and #16, are recent French loans,<br/>\n&gt;  but {Z} for half-z and {J} for #14 is much better than the<br/>\n&gt;  other way around, since half-z is possibly the most used half-<br/>\n&gt;  letter. The question is hopefully not *if* {J} for #14 is<br/>\n&gt;  acceptable for native speakers/writers -- it ought to be at<br/>\n&gt;  least as acceptable as {I} for #27 and {E} for #29, which<br/>\n&gt;  have to be memory-cued with the foreignisms &quot;Igor&quot; and<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;Etude&quot; respectively --, but rather *how* acceptable it is.<br/>\n&gt;  To my Swedish ear #14 and #16 are the French and English<br/>\n&gt;  sound of _j_ respectively, both sounds being foreign to my<br/>\n&gt;  native language.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  It has of course been observed by spelling reformers that<br/>\n&gt;  the functional load of #14 is very low in English, so that<br/>\n&gt;  it might be merged with either #13 or #16, and in that vein<br/>\n&gt;  it might either form a pair with #13 and be mapped to {Z},<br/>\n&gt;  or form a pair with #16 and be mapped to {J}. Read obviously<br/>\n&gt;  saw the sounds of #14 and #16 as related, since he gave them<br/>\n&gt;  letters which were related in shape, but #12 is arguably<br/>\n&gt;  also a related letter-shape for a related sound -- indeed<br/>\n&gt;  #11-16 are a triplet of pairs of related letter-shapes for<br/>\n&gt;  related forms. I&#39;d say the resemblance between #14 and #16<br/>\n&gt;  is greater than between #14 and #12, but then again #13 is<br/>\n&gt;  also closer to #15 than to #11, and I don&#39;t think anybody<br/>\n&gt;  would seriously consider mapping #13 to {C}!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The attractiveness of mapping half-z to {Z} is and remains<br/>\n&gt;  the strongest argument in favor of mapping #14 to {J}, but I<br/>\n&gt;  think it is strong enough. I realize that {J} is hardly the<br/>\n&gt;  native speaker/writer&#39;s first choice for #14, but at least<br/>\n&gt;  Read&#39;s letter-name _J&#39;ai_ will still work!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; To start off discussion, I&#39;d like to see if we can move<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; our proposals closer together over the next couple of<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; weeks. Some of the assignments are fairly independent of<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the rest. I&#39;d like to start with the assignments for #21<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; and alternate #23. I find your suggestion of using G for<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; #21 and N for alternate #21 to greatly improve<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; readability. I think these assignments could be adopted in<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; the other proposals with few, if any, negative<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; ramifications. Peter, Moira, what do you think?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;m willing to move BPJ2 in line with QS-Nu WRT alt #36 and<br/>\n&gt;  #15, although I don&#39;t have the spare time to update my<br/>\n&gt;  documentation ATM.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Also, how much interest is there in following the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; precedent of the Jerome mapping? If there is not, then<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; perhaps you and I could withdraw BPJ1 and QS-Up. That<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; would simplify things. What do you think?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;m definitely willing to withdraw BPJ1. For all the Vulcan<br/>\n&gt;  logic of BPJ1, BPJ2 is frankly much better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; If anyone out there is strongly attached to the Jerome<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; mapping, please speak up!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I would also like to hear what other people, who aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;  proponents themselves, think of the various proposals, ad<br/>\n&gt;  the whole QS-ASCII issue. How many care about it at all?<br/>\n&gt;  If the only ones engaged are the proponents themselves<br/>\n&gt;  there is not much use in spilling any further time and<br/>\n&gt;  bandwidth on this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Ideally we&#39;ll be using whatever QS-ASCII transliteration we<br/>\n&gt;  select only until we get a Unicode mapping for QS. After<br/>\n&gt;  that we will still need keyboard drivers mapping Unicode QS<br/>\n&gt;  letters to the Latin letters on the keyboard as an input<br/>\n&gt;  device, but then there will be nothing to stop people from<br/>\n&gt;  using different keyboard drivers with different mappings<br/>\n&gt;  according to their preference, even making their own drivers<br/>\n&gt;  -- there are free graphical interface programs to help with<br/>\n&gt;  it --, although a collection of downloadable drivers will of<br/>\n&gt;  course be a Good Thing. In practice, however there will<br/>\n&gt;  always be situations when we are not at our own computer,<br/>\n&gt;  and for those situations a standardized transliteration will<br/>\n&gt;  still be desirable for a long time to come. The case with<br/>\n&gt;  phonetic transcription is illustrating: the International<br/>\n&gt;  Phonetic Alphabet has been around in Unicode for some years,<br/>\n&gt;  but people still use ASCII transcriptions like SAMPA and<br/>\n&gt;  others derived from it simply because they are easier to<br/>\n&gt;  type, and there still are mail clients and text editors<br/>\n&gt;  which can&#39;t handle Unicode. It is telling that there even<br/>\n&gt;  are programs for converting back and forth between these<br/>\n&gt;  ASCII schemes and Unicode phonetic characters, as well as<br/>\n&gt;  for converting between different ASCII schemes. Such a<br/>\n&gt;  converter -- even an online one -- between Unicode QS and<br/>\n&gt;  different QS-ASCII schemes would be entirely feasible, but<br/>\n&gt;  an improved 7-bit font standard until we get a Unicode<br/>\n&gt;  standard is still desirable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  /BP 8^)&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  --<br/>\n&gt;  Benct Philip Jonsson -- melroch atte melroch dotte se<br/>\n&gt;  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt;  No man forgets his original trade: the rights of<br/>\n&gt;  nations and of kings sink into questions of grammar,<br/>\n&gt;  if grammarians discuss them.<br/>\n&gt;  -Dr. Samuel Johnson (1707 - 1784)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",

All cases of TO _j_ (or _g_)\n&gt;  corrsponding to #14, and all words where there is variation\n&gt;  between the sounds of #14 and #16, are recent French loans,\n&gt;  but {Z} for half-z and {J} for #14 is much better than the\n&gt;  other way around, since half-z is possibly the most used half-\n&gt;  letter. The question is hopefully not *if* {J} for #14 is\n&gt;  acceptable for native speakers/writers -- it ought to be at\n&gt;  least as acceptable as {I} for #27 and {E} for #29, which\n&gt;  have to be memory-cued with the foreignisms &quot;Igor&quot; and\n&gt;  &quot;Etude&quot; respectively --, but rather *how* acceptable it is.\n&gt;  To my Swedish ear #14 and #16 are the French and English\n&gt;  sound of _j_ respectively, both sounds being foreign to my\n&gt;  native language.\n&gt;\n&gt;  It has of course been observed by spelling reformers that\n&gt;  the functional load of #14 is very low in English, so that\n&gt;  it might be merged with either #13 or #16, and in that vein\n&gt;  it might either form a pair with #13 and be mapped to {Z},\n&gt;  or form a pair with #16 and be mapped to {J}. Read obviously\n&gt;  saw the sounds of #14 and #16 as related, since he gave them\n&gt;  letters which were related in shape, but #12 is arguably\n&gt;  also a related letter-shape for a related sound -- indeed\n&gt;  #11-16 are a triplet of pairs of related letter-shapes for\n&gt;  related forms. I&#39;d say the resemblance between #14 and #16\n&gt;  is greater than between #14 and #12, but then again #13 is\n&gt;  also closer to #15 than to #11, and I don&#39;t think anybody\n&gt;  would seriously consider mapping #13 to {C}!\n&gt;\n&gt;  The attractiveness of mapping half-z to {Z} is and remains\n&gt;  the strongest argument in favor of mapping #14 to {J}, but I\n&gt;  think it is strong enough. I realize that {J} is hardly the\n&gt;  native speaker/writer&#39;s first choice for #14, but at least\n&gt;  Read&#39;s letter-name _J&#39;ai_ will still work!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; To start off discussion, I&#39;d like to see if we can move\n&gt;  &gt; our proposals closer together over the next couple of\n&gt;  &gt; weeks. Some of the assignments are fairly independent of\n&gt;  &gt; the rest. I&#39;d like to start with the assignments for #21\n&gt;  &gt; and alternate #23. I find your suggestion of using G for\n&gt;  &gt; #21 and N for alternate #21 to greatly improve\n&gt;  &gt; readability. I think these assignments could be adopted in\n&gt;  &gt; the other proposals with few, if any, negative\n&gt;  &gt; ramifications. Peter, Moira, what do you think?\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;m willing to move BPJ2 in line with QS-Nu WRT alt #36 and\n&gt;  #15, although I don&#39;t have the spare time to update my\n&gt;  documentation ATM.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Also, how much interest is there in following the\n&gt;  &gt; precedent of the Jerome mapping? If there is not, then\n&gt;  &gt; perhaps you and I could withdraw BPJ1 and QS-Up. That\n&gt;  &gt; would simplify things. What do you think?\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;m definitely willing to withdraw BPJ1. For all the Vulcan\n&gt;  logic of BPJ1, BPJ2 is frankly much better.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; If anyone out there is strongly attached to the Jerome\n&gt;  &gt; mapping, please speak up!\n&gt;\n&gt;  I would also like to hear what other people, who aren&#39;t\n&gt;  proponents themselves, think of the various proposals, ad\n&gt;  the whole QS-ASCII issue. How many care about it at all?\n&gt;  If the only ones engaged are the proponents themselves\n&gt;  there is not much use in spilling any further time and\n&gt;  bandwidth on this.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Ideally we&#39;ll be using whatever QS-ASCII transliteration we\n&gt;  select only until we get a Unicode mapping for QS. After\n&gt;  that we will still need keyboard drivers mapping Unicode QS\n&gt;  letters to the Latin letters on the keyboard as an input\n&gt;  device, but then there will be nothing to stop people from\n&gt;  using different keyboard drivers with different mappings\n&gt;  according to their preference, even making their own drivers\n&gt;  -- there are free graphical interface programs to help with\n&gt;  it --, although a collection of downloadable drivers will of\n&gt;  course be a Good Thing. In practice, however there will\n&gt;  always be situations when we are not at our own computer,\n&gt;  and for those situations a standardized transliteration will\n&gt;  still be desirable for a long time to come. The case with\n&gt;  phonetic transcription is illustrating: the International\n&gt;  Phonetic Alphabet has been around in Unicode for some years,\n&gt;  but people still use ASCII transcriptions like SAMPA and\n&gt;  others derived from it simply because they are easier to\n&gt;  type, and there still are mail clients and text editors\n&gt;  which can&#39;t handle Unicode. It is telling that there even\n&gt;  are programs for converting back and forth between these\n&gt;  ASCII schemes and Unicode phonetic characters, as well as\n&gt;  for converting between different ASCII schemes. Such a\n&gt;  converter -- even an online one -- between Unicode QS and\n&gt;  different QS-ASCII schemes would be entirely feasible, but\n&gt;  an improved 7-bit font standard until we get a Unicode\n&gt;  standard is still desirable.\n&gt;\n&gt;  /BP 8^)&gt;\n&gt;  --\n&gt;  Benct Philip Jonsson -- melroch atte melroch dotte se\n&gt;  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt;  No man forgets his original trade: the rights of\n&gt;  nations and of kings sink into questions of grammar,\n&gt;  if grammarians discuss them.\n&gt;  -Dr. Samuel Johnson (1707 - 1784)\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n"
