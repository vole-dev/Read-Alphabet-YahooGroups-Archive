Your analysis simply shows that we do not write QS phonetically, and that this is a good thing.  If we assign IPA values to QS glyphs, then we are obliged to write phonetically, and my predicate would no longer be a contrapositive, and the result would be an &quot;absurdum.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, your analysis, while interesting, ends up making my point rather than refuting it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg Weidman<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Anthony Grahn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:othermale@...\">othermale@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSent: Friday, November 2, 2007 8:22:02 AM<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: [Read_Alphabet] Re: how to transcribe air and ear<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                              --- In Read_Alphabet@ yahoogroups. com, Gregory Weidman &lt;delrayva@.. .&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n &gt; The thing is: what if he and I were trying to communicate in QS?<br/>\n<br/>\n &gt; Ifwe wrote QS phonetically, I expect we would completely fail at<br/>\n<br/>\n &gt; communication.
