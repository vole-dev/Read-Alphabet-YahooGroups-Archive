Those who don&#39;t have the software to make PDF&#39;s (or those who\ndon&#39;t want to bother figuring out how) could just save their scans as\nJPEG, as long as they weren&#39;t too gigantic.&nbsp; In this case, a PDF would\npractically serve as another picture format, since it will be\nhandwritten text.&nbsp; My suggestion would be to make a separate e-mail\ngroup for those who want to participate, so we wouldn&#39;t have to keep\ntrack of everyone who&#39;s on the list. &lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp; Sign me up, by the way--if anyone needs practice reading\nQuickscript, it&#39;s me!&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;-Benjamin Bruce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;2007/9/22, Paige Gabhart &lt;&lt;a\n moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;

It looked \nas if Google docs had such a service permitting documents to be uploaded \n\nand then viewed by members approved to see them.  I thought that pdf \nwould be an effective way to upload these scanned handwritten letters so \nI checked the googel docs site, and it stated that pdf was one of the \n\nformats they use.  So I then handwrote a letter, which was two pages \nlong, scanned it, saved it in pdf form, put it through PDF.995, which is \na free program which combined the two pages into a single document, and \n\nthen went to google docs, registered and attempted to upload the pdf \nfile.  It was at this point after going to their user forums that I \ndiscovered that you can only _download_ pdf files, not _upload_ them.  I \n\nlove sites that don&#39;t make it clear what their restrictions are!\n\nWe could upload these letters to the group site, but how do we control \nwho adds to them and when or does it make a difference.  Also, \n\nYahoogroups limits our files saved on their server to 100mb.  We could \njust send the pdf file as an attachment in an e-mail to the people \ninterested in the reading practice.  If we had a list of the people \ninterested, I could send my letter to the first person on the list, who \n\nthen adds their letter to it (again, using PDF.995 to combine the pdf \nfiles), and forwards it to the next person on the list.\n\nIs there another format that would be more compact than pdf and/or work \nbetter for what we are trying to accomplish?\n\n\nAny comments, ideas, suggestions?\n\nPaige\n\n    &lt;/pre&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;span width=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n-- &lt;br&gt;\nCheck out Ziphen Central!&lt;br&gt;\nWeekly posts on interesting and unique topics.&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;http://ziphen.benjaminbruce.com&quot;&gt;http://ziphen.&lt;wbr&gt;benjaminbruce.&lt;wbr&gt;com&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--------------010002000709000904030309--\r\n\n"
