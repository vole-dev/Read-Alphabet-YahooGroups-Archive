I _always_ make the \ndistinction between Why and Way and always have.  That is my natural \npronunciation, but I know that I am in the minority now in the U.S.  I \nhave five brothers and I am the eldest.  The brother born after me also \npronounces Why.  The other three do not, and we were all raised in the \nsame family.  It seems very curious to me for this difference in speech \nto exist over such a short period of time.\n\nI suspect that you think of the &quot;h&quot; in the digraph &quot;wh&quot; as a silent \nletter.  I recently heard of an elementary teacher, who, no doubt, \nshared your lack of Why in her idiolect, and she taught her students \nthat the &quot;h&quot; was silent.  I was stunned because it was clear that she \nviewed her idiolect as &quot;normal&quot; and did not realize that a significant \npercentage of the U.S. population still pronounces the &quot;h.&quot;\n\nI use the Why symbol because I pronounce it.  Those who don&#39;t pronounce \nit, presumably don&#39;t use the symbol.  It does not cause any difficulty \nin reading in my opinion.\n\nI also make the distinction between Awe-Ah-Ox.  When I hear someone \npronounce &quot;nautical&quot; as if it were spelled &quot;notical&quot; it seems very \npeculiar to me.  How do you pronounce the word &quot;Awe&quot;?  Does it just \nsound like the vowel in &quot;on&quot;?\n\nGood luck in your QS studies.  I hope the site is useful to you and that \nyou make good progress.  Remember, practice makes perfect.\n\nPaige Gabhart\n\n\nOn 11/15/2010 11:37 PM, leaves_or wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I sought out this group because I was having a hard time \n&gt; distinguishing Awe-Ah-Ox.
