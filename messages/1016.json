  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-762570650\">I have used QS for taking notes at meetings and in school, indeed, I<br/>\nhave used QS for any time when I want to minimize the number of<br/>\nstrokes it takes to accurately record something.  It is clearly faster<br/>\nthan handwriting in the Roman alphabet (RA).  I have never tried to<br/>\nestimate the increase in speed however, and I never really approached<br/>\nQS with the goal of trying to increase the speed with which I wrote<br/>\nit.  Speed was not what attracted me to the alphabet, rather it was<br/>\nits efficiency, logic and beauty.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe Read&#39;s view would have been that while QS is quicker than<br/>\nRA, that is not QS&#39;s goal, but merely a beneficial side effect of its<br/>\ntrue goal -- providing an accurate representation of English with an<br/>\nalphabet that works as an alphabet should, rather than the disaster<br/>\nthat traditional orthography (T.O.)has become over the centuries since<br/>\nbeing grafted onto English.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf speed is your goal, there are numerous shorthand systems that were<br/>\ndesigned specifically for the purpose of making a written record of<br/>\nspeech at normal conversational speeds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, shorthand also seems to be a dying art, as anyone looking<br/>\nfor a secretary that &quot;takes shorthand&quot; could attest to.  These days,<br/>\nyou are looked at as hopelessly antiquarian if you suggest that a<br/>\nsecretary should possess this skill.  I remember watching my father<br/>\ndictate to his secretary.  When he decided to delete a phrase, it was<br/>\nso much easier to have it read back to him than to mess about with a<br/>\ntape recorder.  He would say, &quot;Cross that last part out and add<br/>\nthis....&quot;  Shortly thereafter, he would have the completed letter on<br/>\nhis desk ready to be signed.  Alas...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I have had trouble finding a secretary who believes that<br/>\ntyping at 70-80 words per minute is an attainable skill!  I still<br/>\nremember a couple of candidates who arrived fresh from secretarial<br/>\nschool only a few years ago with 1/2 inch, bright red fingernails. <br/>\nThey seemed nonplussed that I asked them to take a typing test, i.e. a<br/>\n&quot;keyboarding&quot; test for those of you born after 1970.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I digress, my dotage may be nearer than I realized.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason for the absence of extreme abbreviations in the QS manual<br/>\nis simple:  QS is not a shorthand.  Legibility is guarded jealously as<br/>\nit should be for an alphabet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich reminds me of a suggestion in a recent post.  Should we restrict<br/>\nabbreviations for formal writing to the primary seven, and save the<br/>\nmore extensive abbreviations in the QS manual for informal writing, or<br/>\nis that being too old-fashioned?
