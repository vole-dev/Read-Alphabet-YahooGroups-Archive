The term &quot;freeware&quot;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#freeware&quot;&gt;is ambig=\r\nuous&lt;/a&gt;, and I&#39;d rather not allocate my time to playing in someone else&#39;s =\r\nsandbox. As for Kingsley =97 tracking down &quot;tinyallen&quot; shouldn&#39;t be difficu=\r\nlt since he&#39;s been active on the list over the past couple days, but I don&#39;=\r\nt know about Messrs. Stephen Bartok and Oliver Langan. At any rate, the cop=\r\nyright field says &quot;Typeface copyright High-Logic. 1999, 2002. All Rights Re=\r\nserved&quot;, but the license field says &quot;This is a freeware font.&quot;. Since High-=\r\nLogic is a company that makes font-making software, I&#39;d suspect that it was=\r\n inserted without the original author&#39;s intent =97 but I&#39;m not sure. At any=\r\n rate, getting them to publish their font sources =97 as a&nbsp;&lt;a href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://unifiedfontobject.org/&quot;&gt;UFO&lt;/a&gt;, say =97 would be great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fig=\r\nure out, collectively, a&nbsp;&lt;a href=3D&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO=\r\n_phonetic_alphabet&quot;&gt;NATO alphabet&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;for Quikscript (this echoes Tim =\r\nRice&#39;s call for better names). Ideally, all letters should start with the s=\r\nound that they&#39;re for, not be anything that needs a name dot (i.e. no prope=\r\nr names), and be obvious to everyone what each is even when shouted over a =\r\nbad cell-phone connection with significant amounts of background noise. Thi=\r\ns doesn&#39;t need to be the work of one person; Google Spreadsheets sounds lik=\r\ne the sort of thing that could be used to collaborate on all this. This wou=\r\nld help me out personally, because &quot;ah&quot; and &quot;awe&quot; are homophones to my ears=\r\n, and distinguishing between .Ah/.Awe/.Ox is difficult.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make a nice=\r\n chart, ideally in HTML using codepoints in the Private Use Area, that show=\r\ns all the letter combinations one might reasonably make in Quikscript. This=\r\n is useful for testing kerning and alternate letterforms (does .Utter.Low a=\r\nctually get turned into .UtterAlt.Low?) Don&#39;t forget Senior Quikscript abbr=\r\neviations like .Thaw.Ing for &quot;thing&quot;. (Part of) the hard part would be desi=\r\ngning a layout that&#39;s nice and systematic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop a pangram or thr=\r\nee that uses every letter in the Quikscript alphabet. The closest I&#39;ve come=\r\n was &quot;What is the price of a foot-bath kit? A goose in a dress near North S=\r\nquare thought it would cure jelly ankle. The goat nurse suggested palm oil =\r\nin the mouth or wrapped around the ankle with a cloth.&quot; =97 which is still =\r\nmissing the following sounds: S, Z, tS, j, h, W. Oh, and it&#39;s too effing lo=\r\nng to fit in my head. The checker I used I&#39;ve posted as&nbsp;&lt;a href=3D&quot;htt=\r\nps://gist.github.com/adiabatic/5905628&quot;&gt;a gist on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;=97 if th=\r\nere&#39;s demand, I could redo the thing in Javascript and put it out there on =\r\nmy website similar to the&nbsp;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.frogorbits.com/qs/from=\r\n-shavian/&quot;&gt;Shavian converter&lt;/a&gt;. Again, none of this needs to be done as s=\r\nolitary work =97 having some back-and-forth with others, in public, on thin=\r\ngs like this&#39;d be nice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You could also s=\r\ntart a blog in Quikscript, as I&#39;ve done. If you&#39;re having trouble getting i=\r\nt to work right, don&#39;t hesitate to ask on the list. Similarly, if you&#39;re ha=\r\nving trouble getting Quikscript to work OK in whatever you&#39;re doing, ask on=\r\n the list. Making QS less annoying to use on the computer will help adoptio=\r\nn, but I don&#39;t know where the usual pain points are, especially for Windows=\r\n users who aren&#39;t computer nerds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thank you for he=\r\nlping us help you help us all,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot; sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;white-space:pre;&quot;&gt;\t&lt;/span&gt;Nathan&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On=\r\n Jul 1, 2013, at 12:23 PM, HeyMister &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:booth.g@...=\r\nm&quot;&gt;booth.g@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div=\r\n dir=3D&quot;auto&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Helvetica;font-size: medium;font-style:=\r\n normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: normal;tex=\r\nt-indent: 0px;text-transform: none;white-space: normal;word-spacing: 0px;&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;And now I know why the group is dead.
