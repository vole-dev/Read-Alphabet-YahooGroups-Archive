Well, after a bit of creative hackery (find/replace all ad nauseum) I have the World English Bible nearly 80% in Quickscript. Running low on common words, the true fun is soon to start. If anyone has the interest and time, it would be amazing if they could adopt a book or two and sculpt the remaining bits of non-markup Latin away. I chose a USFMed file compatible with the very capable program Bibledit to make versification and layout a non-issue. The Quickscript text follows the Kingsley Unicode scheme so an input method that supports it is key. Aside from that, come one come all to the virtual transcribing hall.</div>",
