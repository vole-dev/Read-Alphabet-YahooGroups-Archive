I removed the half letters and replaced <br/>\nu with a.  I also tried to keep it so that Shavian writers would have <br/>\nlittle learning time. I added space between the letters so that it <br/>\nis  more like a type face.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy?  I believe that many of the modifications Read made to <br/>\nquickscript works as a printed improvement to Shavian.  This Junior <br/>\nQuickscript is meant to incorporate all of those, without adding the <br/>\nflourish and complication of the joined and half letters.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy hope is that this junior quickscript font may be more readable and <br/>\neasier on some reader&#39;s eyes. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only major change I made in the keyboard was to include the Wheat <br/>\ncharacter as cap W, as the cap W was no longer needed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am open to critique and suggestions on this experimental font.
