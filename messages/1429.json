Examples from this week: &quot;pig&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;kick&quot;. An example of a missed word from the week before: &quot;what&quot;<br/>\nmispelled &quot;wut&quot;. (They&#39;re taught to sound out words.) My son is in<br/>\nthird grade and also loves it, but to him it&#39;s more of a secret code.<br/>\nIt&#39;s definitely more fun than practicing cursive, which he sees no<br/>\npoint in doing. My wife rolls her eyes and asks, Why don&#39;t you just<br/>\nlearn to spell?<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t really set out to teach them, but when I offered to sit down<br/>\nand write with them on the same ruled paper they use at school, they<br/>\nwere all over it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTed<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 11, 2007 8:49 PM, pgabhart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pgabhart@...\">pgabhart@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Paul:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I thought after I wrote the comment about being more fluent in reading QS<br/>\n&gt; that it might be disconcerting.  I read two of the articles in the News in<br/>\n&gt; QS with interest today, and I have been reading what others are writing by<br/>\n&gt; hand in QS without problems in recent weeks.  I write it fluently just as<br/>\n&gt; Moira mentioned she does.  The problem is not with QS but with the amount of<br/>\n&gt; practice that we receive.  I just cannot read QS as fast as TO, which is not<br/>\n&gt; surprising when you consider that we are surrounded by TO all the time and<br/>\n&gt; that we learned it as children. I daresay that if as a child you had been<br/>\n&gt; told how TO worked, but were given no reading practice in it, no one around<br/>\n&gt; you used it, and you never received anything written in it, you would be<br/>\n&gt; just as slow at reading TO as you are now at reading QS.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I would like to attain the reading speed in QS that I have in TO.  That<br/>\n&gt; goal is still some distance away, but it is getting closer.  For the first<br/>\n&gt; time, with the ability to communicate effectively in QS and to read<br/>\n&gt; articles, news, etc. written in it, I have no question that goal can be<br/>\n&gt; attained.  I can already see that my QS reading speed has been increasing in<br/>\n&gt; recent weeks.  And even now, I&#39;m not reading QS every day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Just as a beginning TO reader sounds words out, we have to do that in QS<br/>\n&gt; until we begin to automatically recognize word outlines.  Until recently<br/>\n&gt; that has not been feasible because there are too few of us, and we tend to<br/>\n&gt; only read what we write ourselves.  For instance, I take notes in QS as<br/>\n&gt; secretary of a club I&#39;m in.  I then go back and transliterate them on the<br/>\n&gt; computer for the club records.  Thus, my reading speed isn&#39;t critical and QS<br/>\n&gt; is still useful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  A fluent reader recognizes words at sight and doesn&#39;t have to break them<br/>\n&gt; down into individual syllables or letters.  However, in reading your news<br/>\n&gt; today, I saw numerous words in QS for the first time.  The shorter, common<br/>\n&gt; words I read quickly and essentially automatically just as I do in TO.  But<br/>\n&gt; three, four and five syllable words that are unfamiliar are a different<br/>\n&gt; matter.  Here are a few words I remember reading in QS for the first time<br/>\n&gt; today, and there are countless others: Islamabad, Islamic militants,<br/>\n&gt; Afghanistan, Land Cruiser, bullet-proofed (this last one hasn&#39;t come up much<br/>\n&gt; in my personal note-taking.)   :-).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Since the term &quot;Islamic militants&quot; was in the Pakistan story several times,<br/>\n&gt; it began looking familiar by the end of the story, but that is what has to<br/>\n&gt; occur to build up reading speed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Paige<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  P.S.  Here is an example of the pressure we face against using QS.  A few<br/>\n&gt; years ago, I was taking notes in QS in a case.  Later my father, with whom I<br/>\n&gt; practiced, would be looking at a file, and tell me that I needed to write in<br/>\n&gt; TO.  His customary comment was, &quot;What if you get hit by a bus, and I have to<br/>\n&gt; take this case over.  I won&#39;t be able to read your notes.&quot;  The same problem<br/>\n&gt; exists when my secretary is working on a document and has to refer to the<br/>\n&gt; file.  If there are notes in QS, I have to rewrite them for her, which isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; exactly a time-saver.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  What would be interesting would be for someone to teach their child to read<br/>\n&gt; QS before they go to school and see how easily they take to it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Paul Tremblay wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Paige Gabhart wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Paul:<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Let me add my superlatives to the others.

It also makes<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; me realize how much more reading practice I need to get truly fluent in<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; reading QS.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Thanks everyone for the compliments.
