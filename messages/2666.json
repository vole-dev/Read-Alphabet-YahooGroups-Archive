Would it be desirable to create an English Academy, modeled on\n&gt;     the Academie Fran\u00e7aise? Would it even be possible?\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s not.  The AF is a horrible model.  It takes forever to do \n&gt; anything, its dictionary is neither very good nor very authoritative \n&gt; in actual use (though it is theoretically official in France), it has \n&gt; a history of opposing all recognition of the regional languages of \n&gt; France.  Of the 35 present members (five seats are vacant), only six \n&gt; were born outside France and only one (Haitian Canadian Dany \n&gt; Laferri\u00e8re) is living outside France; this despite the fact that less \n&gt; than a third of French-speakers live in France.\n&gt;\n&gt;     2. If the Read Alphabet were widely adopted, might we no longer\n&gt;     see the value of standardization, in favor of spelling how you\n&gt;     speak? Is this a bad thing or a good thing?\n&gt;\n&gt; Historically, standardization has been something publishers have \n&gt; insisted on.  If every author spells just as they like, the result is \n&gt; orthographic chaos, and proofreading becomes impossible.  Even \n&gt; Cherokee, which was not written until the 19C, has a fairly \n&gt; well-established standard spelling that doesn&#39;t agree exactly with any \n&gt; one of the various dialects of Cherokee, themselves products of the \n&gt; 19C as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; At present, orthographies are stabilized by a feedback loop between \n&gt; publishers and lexicographers.  Publishers adopt a particular \n&gt; dictionary as their authority for spelling, but the spellings that \n&gt; appear in dictionaries are those used by publishers.  The process \n&gt; rapidly converges on a standard orthography without any single source \n&gt; of authority.\n&gt;\n&gt;     3. One way to standardize phonetic spelling to standardize a\n&gt;     proper manner of speaking. (I think this refers back to question\n&gt;     1). Should one accent be considered &quot;standard&quot;?And which one? And why?\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s hopeless.  The matter would instantly become a political \n&gt; football (round or oval) between the U.S. and the UK, with the rest of \n&gt; the world acting as something between astonished bystanders and swing \n&gt; voters.\n&gt;\n&gt; What can, and I believe should, be done is to establish a writing \n&gt; system that makes the distinctions required by any of the living \n&gt; accents of Standard English.  In this way, English-speakers would \n&gt; easily be able to pronounce any written word according to their own \n&gt; accent, but would have to learn in some cases how a word should be \n&gt; written so as to be read correctly by all English-speakers.  The Read \n&gt; alphabet already provides this in the matter of post-vocalic &quot;r&quot;, but \n&gt; would need a few more letters to cover all the vowel sounds of English.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example Read has only one letter for the sounds of &quot;term&quot;, &quot;dirt&quot;, \n&gt; and &quot;nurse&quot;, but would require three for Scottish English, which \n&gt; pronounces them all differently, and for Irish English, which \n&gt; pronounces two of them the same but the other differently.  (Note that \n&gt; traditional orthography already caters to this requirement.)  This \n&gt; would be a small burden for other writers of English, but would \n&gt; eliminate the notion that some accents are preferred to others, as \n&gt; there is no internationally preferred accent.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\r\n--------------7B5FD228859902DEBADE1F61\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body text=&quot;#000000&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The AF is far worse than I had imagined.

If the Read Alphabet were widely adopted,\n                      might we no longer see the value of\n                      standardization, in favor of spelling how you\n                      speak? Is this a bad thing or a good thing?&lt;/p&gt;\n                  &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n                  &lt;div&gt;Historically, standardization has been something\n                    publishers have insisted on.\u00a0 If every author spells\n                    just as they like, the result is orthographic chaos,\n                    and proofreading becomes impossible.\u00a0 Even Cherokee,\n                    which was not written until the 19C, has a fairly\n                    well-established standard spelling that doesn&#39;t\n                    agree exactly with any one of the various dialects\n                    of Cherokee, themselves products of the 19C as well.&lt;/div&gt;\n                  &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n                  &lt;/div&gt;\n                  &lt;div&gt;At present, orthographies are stabilized by a\n                    feedback loop between publishers and\n                    lexicographers.\u00a0 Publishers adopt a particular\n                    dictionary as their authority for spelling, but the\n                    spellings that appear in dictionaries are those used\n                    by publishers.\u00a0 The process rapidly converges on a\n                    standard orthography without any single source of\n                    authority.&lt;/div&gt;\n                  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=&quot;margin:0px 0px\n                    0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;p&gt;3. One way to standardize phonetic spelling to\n                      standardize a proper manner of speaking. (I think\n                      this refers back to question 1). Should one accent\n                      be considered &quot;standard&quot;?And which one? And why?&lt;/p&gt;\n                  &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n                That&#39;s hopeless.\u00a0 The matter would instantly become a\n                political football (round or oval) between the U.S. and\n                the UK, with the rest of the world acting as something\n                between astonished bystanders and swing voters.&lt;/div&gt;\n              &lt;div class=&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n              &lt;div class=&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;What can, and I believe should,\n                be done is to establish a writing system that makes the\n                distinctions required by any of the living accents of\n                Standard English.\u00a0 In this way, English-speakers would\n                easily be able to pronounce any written word according\n                to their own accent, but would have to learn in some\n                cases how a word should be written so as to be read\n                correctly by all English-speakers.\u00a0 The Read alphabet\n                already provides this in the matter of post-vocalic &quot;r&quot;,\n                but would need a few more letters to cover all the vowel\n                sounds of English.&lt;/div&gt;\n              &lt;div class=&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n              &lt;div class=&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;For example Read has only one\n                letter for the sounds of &quot;term&quot;, &quot;dirt&quot;, and &quot;nurse&quot;,\n                but would require three for Scottish English, which\n                pronounces them all differently, and for Irish English,\n                which pronounces two of them the same but the other\n                differently. \u00a0(Note that traditional orthography already\n                caters to this requirement.) \u00a0This would be a small\n                burden for other writers of English, but would eliminate\n                the notion that some accents are preferred to others, as\n                there is no internationally preferred accent.&lt;br&gt;\n                &lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n          \n      \n      &lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--------------7B5FD228859902DEBADE1F61--\r\n\n"
