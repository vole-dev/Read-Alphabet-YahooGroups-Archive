For the CMU dictionary, I am using Ah (#32)<br/>\n&gt;  for AA and Awl (#33) for AO, exactly as you would. That should be<br/>\n&gt;  happening, anyway. However, I have a personal dictionary that overrides<br/>\n&gt;  the CMU dictionary. The personal dictionary right now consists of the<br/>\n&gt;  2000 most commonly used words in the English language, as well as about<br/>\n&gt;  400 more that I have used in transliteration some Grimm&#39;s fairy tales.<br/>\n&gt;  To create my personal dictionary, I took the 2000 words from CMU and<br/>\n&gt;  corrected what I thought were mistakes. I used my American Heritage<br/>\n&gt;  Dictionary to look up the pronunciations of such words as &quot;pot,&quot; because<br/>\n&gt;  I can&#39;t distinguish between &quot;On&quot; and &quot;Awl.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I use &quot;Ah,&quot; &quot;Awl,&quot; and &quot;On,&quot; in my personal dictionary, since my<br/>\n&gt;  American Heritage Dictionary makes that distinction. My newer Longman<br/>\n&gt;  dictionary does not. I hope that we who are working on defining lexical<br/>\n&gt;  sets can decide what to do in situations like this. After a while,<br/>\n&gt;  alphabets get defined on how they are used, just as our TO alphabet did.<br/>\n&gt;  So I want to use QS that is reasonable and readable for everyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  You will notice some inconsistencies in the news. Since my personal<br/>\n&gt;  dictionary contains the *most* commonly used words, you may see a lot of<br/>\n&gt;  words spelled with &quot;On&quot; whereas a word right next to it, that rhymes,<br/>\n&gt;  and that is taken from the CMU dictionary, uses &quot;Awl&quot; or &quot;Ahh.&quot; Another<br/>\n&gt;  inconsistency, however, occurs because the CMU dictionary contains<br/>\n&gt;  errors. I don&#39;t just mean different ways of pronouncing words than I<br/>\n&gt;  have, but outright errors such as putting a &quot;b&quot; before an &quot;r.&quot; I think<br/>\n&gt;  these errors also carry over to some of the vowel choices as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  If you have suggestions on word choice (and this applies to anyone), and<br/>\n&gt;  you want to make a change, just send me a text file with the TO word on<br/>\n&gt;  the left, followed by some space, followed by the QS word in ASCII.
