QS has an intrinsic \nbeauty which is, alas, not captured in the clunky Jerome font.  I \nhave been at work on a substitute myself for some time, using more \ncalligraphic forms.  I too found linkages a major stumbling block.\n\nMore general thoughts later, but first:\n\nIn direct reply to your first query, I take &quot;mere&quot; to be exactly \n27-36-25. That is, it is a quickly pronounced two syllable word \n&quot;mi-er&quot;, (it&#39;s not like the French word &quot;mer,&quot; 29-25) and it is \nwritten with the &quot;er&quot; combination, as Read details it in the middle \nof page 10 (&quot;baker, gather, etc&quot;).  While certain dialects and \npurists may disagree here, as Read puts it &quot;any subtle distinctions \nbetween these sounds are neither heard not spelt successfully and \nconsistently by all writers.&quot;\n\nNow on to a larger issue: It appears to me that the issue of \n&quot;half-letters&quot; needs addressing directly at the start of your \nproject. Their adoption in handwriting is designed to increase speed \nin writing and, I suspect, just because they are pretty and add to \nthe visual flow of the script.\n\nBut what is being designed here is a computer font, and it does not \nhave to ape the calligraphy of the hand written word.  Just as \nMedieval calligraphers drove themselves to distraction trying to ape \nwith their quill pens the Roman letters carved with chisels in the \nstone on Trajan&#39;s column, and so wound up inventing the uncials, \nwhich took full advantage of their medium, we are now at a juncture \nin history where we are in danger of trying to ape QS calligraphy \nwhile punching keys on a keyboard.\n\nIt all depends on what you want to achieve: if, as in hand-done QS, \nit&#39;s all about efficiency and minimal &quot;pen lifts&quot; or keystrokes, then \nany computer alphabet that takes two keystrokes, or a key \ncombination, to write one phoneme is just plain silly.  Better to use \nthe 40 letters of junior QS assigned to 40 keys, while adopting only \nthe abbreviated spelling conventions of Senior QS, and casting the \nhalf-letters to the wind.\n\nOn the other hand, if beauty and display are the main goals of \nwriting QS on a computer, then the number of keystrokes be damned. \nHail to the half-letters, and any other myriad linkages that may be \nthought of!\n\n(If goal 2 is the one you choose, a suggestion here:  the Jerome font \nseems to have been designed in a Luddite manner, as if for a 1900 \nSmith Corona, utilizing only the good old shift key for odd \ncharacters.  If one acknowledges that we are indeed designing for a \ncomputer keyboard, then we have the Command (or Apple), Option, and \nControl Keys at our disposal, all within a quarter inch of the old \nShift key..  Thus every basic character could have 4 variations, \ninstead of 1, and still reside on a logical home key.)\n\nAnother question that arises: should the sounds be assigned to the \nQWERTY arrangement of letters (another Luddite scheme if there ever \nwas on, but advantageous for those that look at the keyboard) or \nshould they be assigned according to phoneme frequency of use, \nrequiring minimal finger movement, a la Dvorak?

I am designing a replacement truetype font for Jerome.\n&gt;This new font (called KINGSLEY.TTF) will include (among other things)\n&gt;a more intuitive keyboard layout based on a one-to-one conversion\n&gt;between the sounds of T.O. and Readscript, characters with standard\n&gt;stroke widths and joining points, and kerning pairs that provide what\n&gt;I perceive to be the best representation of the way Readscript was\n&gt;meant to be written.\n&gt;\n&gt;For consistency&#39;s sake, I am currently going to be the only active\n&gt;developer until the font reaches a suitable beta release state, but I\n&gt;would like the input and participation of all Readscript enthusiasts\n&gt;in this endeavor, such that we can truely have a font written\n&gt;by-enthusiasts-for-enthusiasts and one that we can all have some\n&gt;amount of personal involvement and satisfaction in.\n&gt;\n&gt;There are, of course, stumbling blocks to be overcome and questions\n&gt;about standardization that need to be asked, so I have decided to ask\n&gt;them here and now (even though the characters are only about halfway\n&gt;finished).\n&gt;\n&gt;To kick things off, my first question to the quickscript community\n&gt;regards the joining of characters to letter #25/Roe.\n&gt;\n&gt;As is plainly seen, the character was designed with two joining\n&gt;points, both of which are incoming points and exist on the same\n&gt;x-plane.

When examined\n&gt;further, however, one notes that most of these characters would NEVER\n&gt;join to #25, except perhaps #7 or #27.  I have noticed on page 13 of\n&gt;the Quickscript Manual that there seemes to be an extra character #36\n&gt;in the example &quot;mere&quot; (27-36-25).  Is this really #36, or one of the\n&gt;&quot;confusing linking strokes&quot; that Read talks about?  If it IS #36, is\n&gt;this because of English pronunciation?\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks, and I look forward to further input in participation in this\n&gt;project\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!

(I do have some pseudo-scientific\ninformation on phoneme frequency.)&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;And finallly, one request: in your work don&#39;t forget us Mac\nusers when you do publish your font.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Good luck!&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;blockquote type=&quot;cite&quot; cite&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Hello all.&nbsp; I am designing a\nreplacement truetype font for Jerome.&lt;br&gt;\nThis new font (called KINGSLEY.TTF) will include (among other\nthings)&lt;br&gt;\na more intuitive keyboard layout based on a one-to-one conversion&lt;br&gt;\nbetween the sounds of T.O. and Readscript, characters with\nstandard&lt;br&gt;\nstroke widths and joining points, and kerning pairs that provide\nwhat&lt;br&gt;\nI perceive to be the best representation of the way Readscript was&lt;br&gt;\nmeant to be written.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nFor consistency&#39;s sake, I am currently going to be the only active&lt;br&gt;\ndeveloper until the font reaches a suitable beta release state, but\nI&lt;br&gt;\nwould like the input and participation of all Readscript\nenthusiasts&lt;br&gt;\nin this endeavor, such that we can truely have a font\nwritten&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote type=&quot;cite&quot; cite&gt;&lt;tt&gt;by-enthusiasts-for-enthusiasts and\none that we can all have some&lt;br&gt;\namount of personal involvement and satisfaction in.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere are, of course, stumbling blocks to be overcome and\nquestions&lt;br&gt;\nabout standardization that need to be asked, so I have decided to\nask&lt;br&gt;\nthem here and now (even though the characters are only about\nhalfway&lt;br&gt;\nfinished).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTo kick things off, my first question to the quickscript community&lt;br&gt;\nregards the joining of characters to letter #25/Roe.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs is plainly seen, the character was designed with two joining&lt;br&gt;\npoints, both of which are incoming points and exist on the same&lt;br&gt;\nx-plane.&nbsp; It shares the first of these properties with #22/May,\nand&lt;br&gt;\nshares both of these properties with only one other character:&lt;br&gt;\n#37/OUt. This introduces problems in font design when being\nconnected&lt;br&gt;\nto by any characters that cross into the x-plane through or beyond&lt;br&gt;\nboth joining sites (i.e. #&#39;s 3, 7, 10, 14, 26, 27).&nbsp; When\nexamined&lt;br&gt;\nfurther, however, one notes that most of these characters would\nNEVER&lt;br&gt;\njoin to #25, except perhaps #7 or #27.&nbsp; I have noticed on page\n13 of&lt;br&gt;\nthe Quickscript Manual that there seemes to be an extra character\n#36&lt;br&gt;\nin the example &quot;mere&quot; (27-36-25).&nbsp; Is this really #36,\nor one of the&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;confusing linking strokes&quot; that Read talks about?&nbsp; If\nit IS #36, is&lt;br&gt;\nthis because of English pronunciation?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThanks, and I look forward to further input in participation in\nthis&lt;br&gt;\nproject&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot; color=&quot;#003399&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yahoo!
