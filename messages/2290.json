When I saw the Shaw Alphabet for the first time back on April 16th, 2002, I thought it was one of the most beautiful writing systems I&#39;d ever seen, so much so that 2 days later I became determined to do something about it when I found out that it was the only book published in the alphabet. Quikskript... not so much. I read through the QuikSkript guide and ended up with more questions than answers. I found it really confusing and there appeared to be many instances where things that look identical could be pronounced differently. For example, Read said that you could use the ng character to represent the suffix -ing. For example, would Commander Data&#39;s creator be Noonien Soong, or Noonien Suing? In the Shaw Alphabet it&#39;s obvious, but in the Read Alphabet you can never be sure. I have the same basic issue with Paul Vandenbrink&#39;s &quot;Shaw Alphabet&quot; in how he merged ALL of the vowels into 2-3 characters, so good luck trying to read a story about the 5 sisters Jane, Jan, Jen, Joan, June and their brother John. Wow, I hope that I didn&#39;t just completely alienate this group as potential customers with this message...</div>",
