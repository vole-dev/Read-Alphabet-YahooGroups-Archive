I would just advise you to realize that QS does not \nrequire that every letter be joined to every other letter.  QS is quite \ncursive as Read designed it.  The small amount of time required for the \noccasional pen-lift, is not worth the confusion of muddying the phonemic \ncharacter, might I say, &quot;purity,&quot; of the alphabet.\n\nJust my two cents.\n\n\nPaige Gabhart\n\n\nOn 8/18/2011 12:12 PM, cossyrosario wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks, Sid.\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason why I didn&#39;t use this work-around is because I&#39;ve been \n&gt; trying to follow the QuikScript rule that the letters represent \n&gt; /sounds/ of the English language.\n&gt;\n&gt; In com- con- the o sound is like the u in utter (as in commend, \n&gt; contend), or like the o in ox (compliment, conscious). The o when \n&gt; written as in Latin letters (as a circle) has the sound of owe in owe. \n&gt; Therefore com- with the circle o would rhyme with comb, and con- with \n&gt; the circle o would rhyme with cone, which is not what I want to.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, if I were making notes for myself, as is the case most of the \n&gt; time I use QuikScript, I could certainly use the o as a private \n&gt; work-around.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I have been using as an even shorter work-around for temporary \n&gt; private notes (to-do list, notes of a meeting discussion to be \n&gt; transcribed fairly soon on the computer) is just the k as a prefix, \n&gt; thus kputer for computer, kshus for conscious, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com, Sid Tanaban &lt;sidban2@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; com or con can be written in one stroke. \ufffd Just write the &quot;o&quot; as you \n&gt; would in latin letters and add the &quot;m&quot; \ufffd  Unfortunately, I have no \n&gt; idea how to do this on a computer.\n&gt; &gt; Sid\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On Wed, 8/17/11, cossyrosario cossyrosario@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: cossyrosario cossyrosario@...\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [Read_Alphabet] Re: I&#39;d like to be able to write the \n&gt; prefixes com- and con- as contractions\n&gt; &gt; To: Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Wednesday, August 17, 2011, 11:20 PM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you, Steve!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In my hurry to learn as much as possible as soon as possible, I raced\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; through the manual, and must have raced past the section on com- con- as\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; it must have seemed obvious, with nothing new to learn!
