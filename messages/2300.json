While the obvious culprit is &lt;BODY BGCOLOR=0&gt; (a horribly ambiguous statement), there are quite a few things on the page that ought to be brought up to date. While ordinarily this sort of thing would best be handled off-list, I&#39;ve seen more than a few Second Shaw fan pages that use antiquated constructions like &lt;font&gt; elements and other holdouts from 1995. Since we&#39;ve all moved on from listening to Lou Bega&#39;s &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot; and wearing corduroy shorts with 12&quot; inseams, let&#39;s redo this page using more modern idioms\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we&#39;ll be doing HTML5, a link to the current version of the standard is in order. Here it is:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/\">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou may also want to read <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developers.whatwg.org/\">http://developers.whatwg.org/</a> which strips out stuff that only browser makers need to worry about.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom here on down, indented bits will be markup and styling, while outdented parts will be my commentary.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, let&#39;s start with a DOCTYPE:<br/>\n<br/>\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one of the more important things that you can put in your page; it tells browsers that you want them to try and interpret your page using modern rules (as opposed to backward-compatible-with-IE3 rules).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the rest of the skeleton:<br/>\n<br/>\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br/>\n    &lt;html lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;<br/>\n        &lt;head&gt;<br/>\n            &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;<br/>\n            &lt;title&gt;Untitled&lt;/title&gt;<br/>\n        &lt;/head&gt;<br/>\n        &lt;body&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n        &lt;/body&gt;<br/>\n    &lt;/html&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, so good.

Additionally, for attributes, double quotes are common, but single quotes are just fine too (and less Shift-key intensive, besides).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, you should be quoting all your attribute values unless you&#39;re prepared to memorize a list of what can and can&#39;t safely be unquoted \u2014 and I never was.<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we have now is a page that has all the old information on it, but is now black-on-white instead of gray-on-black.
