It is not too jarring to mix standard<br>\northography and Quickscript, so when referring to something in &#39;the<br>\nkey of F flat&#39; the F could remain written in Latin.  Acronyms are the<br>\nsame, though if we are not careful we will get ourselves into exactly<br>\nthe same situation as the Japanese where up to four writing systems<br>\nare intermixed constantly (Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana, Romaji/Latin). <br>\nI would hate to see what a Japanese/Arabic dictionary looks like ;)<br>\n<br>\nAlternately, new acronyms could be made up: but how to distinguish<br>\nthem as acronyms?  &quot;Fie-Bay-It&quot; is just as easy to say as &quot;FBI&quot; but<br>\nthe idea of putting a name dot in front of each character is<br>\nunappealing: &quot;dot fie dot bay dot it&quot; is certainly no easier to write<br>\nthan the Latin version.  And as PhD points out, often the acronyms are<br>\nmore well known than the names themselves, anyway.  Personally, I vote<br>\nfor the mix: QS + Latin characters.<br>\n<br>\namd64_hacker, I am not familiar with xkb, sorry; but I have been<br>\nsuccessful in making keyboard maps on Mac OS X.  That is how I have<br>\nbeen entering unicode in my tests, recently, and I have to admit that<br>\nmy own keyboard map (in the files section) is good but not great: it<br>\nrequires too much use of the shift key.  Also, when it is active, none<br>\nof the hot-keys work as I expect them to (command-x, etc.), since<br>\nthose letters have been remapped.  I think a good way to go might be<br>\nlike my wife&#39;s Chinese-input keyboard: when the caps-lock key is down,<br>\nit types Latin characters; when up, it types strokes which get<br>\nassembled into full characters.  In our case, a keyboard mapping which<br>\nis standard Latin + numbers normally, but Quickscript when Caps Lock<br>\nis down, would be ideal: it could be left on virtually all the time (I<br>\nnever use the Caps Lock myself, in fact having remapped it to act like<br>\na second control key).<br>\n<br>\nI looked at your perl script, but I can&#39;t make out the actual mapping:<br>\ndoes the hex code in @keys refer to its current or new mapping?  Any<br>\nway we could get a more visual example?<br>\n<br>\noliver<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n    </div>  \n\n    \n    <span style=\"color:white;\"></span>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></div></blockquote></div><br><br clear=\"all\"><br>-- <br>Subscribe to Samara - The Literary Journal<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samaramag.com\">www.samaramag.com</a>\n </span></blockquote></div>",
