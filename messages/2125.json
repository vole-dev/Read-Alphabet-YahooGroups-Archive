For most people who make the<br/>\n&gt; distinction, the word &quot;awe&quot; is just a shorter form of this expression.<br/>\n&gt; When traditional orthography writes &quot;au&quot; or &quot;aw&quot;, this generally<br/>\n&gt; represents Awe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Similarly, Americans, except those from Eastern New England, have trouble<br/>\n&gt; knowing when to write the Ox sound, since most of us use Ah instead.<br/>\n&gt; Traditional spelling is likewise fairly reliable here: if we write &quot;o&quot;<br/>\n&gt; or &quot;wa&quot; it&#39;s Ox, if we write &quot;a&quot; otherwise it&#39;s Ah.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Secondly, what didn&#39;t seem clear to me from Read&#39;s manual was whether<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you should write according to your own pronunciation, or whether there<br/>\n&gt;&gt; was some &#39;master&#39; pronunciation to which you write phonetically.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Read never made that clear.
