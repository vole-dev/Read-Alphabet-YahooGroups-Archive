[emphasis added]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the following paragraph under &quot;Alternate Forms,&quot; I suggest changing<br/>\n&gt; the word &quot;usually&quot; to &quot;highly&quot; since some letters can be properly<br/>\n&gt; connected and some cannot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Many letters have half height or alternate forms in order to help<br/>\n&gt; speed up writing by reducing the number of strokes and pen lifts.<br/>\n&gt; The half height and alternate forms are only used in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsenior\u00e2\u20ac\u2122<br/>\n&gt; QuikScript which is /usually/ cursive. [emphasis added]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Whether a given writer decides to connect any letter to another is his<br/>\n&gt; choice, but I would consider it improper to extend or change the form<br/>\n&gt; of a letter in order to make a connection to the next letter possible.<br/>\n&gt; I believe the only exceptions approved by Read in the QS manual are<br/>\n&gt; for the letters with alternate forms (N-o and U-tter) and for F-ee,<br/>\n&gt; M-ay and TH-ey.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The alternate &quot;TH-ey&quot; extends the bottom of the letter upwards to the<br/>\n&gt; lower writing line to permit connection with the next letter. Read<br/>\n&gt; terms this an &quot;allowable extension,&quot; but it seems to me it should be<br/>\n&gt; considered an alternate form and listed that way in the proposal.<br/>\n&gt; While the end stroke of F-ee can also be extended to join the next<br/>\n&gt; letter, that seems less important to me so, in my opinion, it could be<br/>\n&gt; left out of the proposal.

You list 15 such letters, but the QS manual lists<br/>\n&gt; only P-ea, T-ea, H-e, D-ay, Z-oo, and W-ay. In addition to those, I<br/>\n&gt; have used WH-y and Y-e for decades since they work as half-letters<br/>\n&gt; just as well as the six Read suggested. I had actually forgotten they<br/>\n&gt; are not listed in the manual as half-letters until Jon Zuck pointed it<br/>\n&gt; out to me. Since it is clear what letters they are, it just made sense<br/>\n&gt; to me. Besides, I love the way the half-letters contribute to the<br/>\n&gt; variety of wordshapes possible in QS. However, you have added seven<br/>\n&gt; more: F-ee, V-ie, S-ee, SH-e, J&#39;-ai, CH-eer, J-ay. I believe this is<br/>\n&gt; incorrect. Can you explain how they can be used as half-height forms?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have never used the two &quot;x&quot; letters as they always struck me as<br/>\n&gt; outside the spirit of QS -- 1 phoneme to 1 symbol. It was Read&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; stated goal for &quot;x&quot; to &quot;compete&quot; with the TO &quot;x&quot; as if that was<br/>\n&gt; necessary to avoid people deciding that QS was not viable because of<br/>\n&gt; two instances where it took two QS symbols when only one was needed in<br/>\n&gt; TO. Should &quot;x&quot; be included in the proposal. It is in the manual, and I<br/>\n&gt; guess that if it is coded, then people can choose whether to use it or<br/>\n&gt; not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m impressed with the rest of the proposal.
