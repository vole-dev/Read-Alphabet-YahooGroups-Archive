Mr. Read found that there was difficulty in people from different countries understanding each other due to their accents.  For example, we could hardly be expected to read a cockney accent in Shaws Alphabet.  For written material to yourself there is no problem at all.  But, if you do have a regional accent and want to correspond with people outside your region then it would be obvious that you would have to conform to the standard English pronunciation.  This is a part of understanding how to use it on a national or international scale.  And, it is a courtesy on your part.  Checking out whether a reader could understand your particular accent would be common sense.
