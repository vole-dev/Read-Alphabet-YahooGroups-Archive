Look at the beginning and ending points and \nwhether a vertical line drawn through the beginning would touch the end \nof the letter or not.  The top of Shush is just about directly over the \nbottom of the letter, and it slopes more to the right (i.e. there is \nmore of an arch) than Th-ey does.  Thither begins to the left of where \nit ends, probably to insure that it is not mistaken for P-ea..  Th-ey \nends directly under where it starts.  So, the short answer is, no.  They \naren&#39;t mirror images of each other.\n\nBob and Pipe are mirror images except that Bob bends back as it \napproaches the base line in order to make it possible to connect to the \nnext letter if it starts at the base line.  This is a change from \nShavian in which the two letters were mirror images, if my memory is \ncorrect.\n\nPaige\n\nPaul Tremblay wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; This day is brought to you by the letter Fife.
