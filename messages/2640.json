I tried to optimize the font for eas=\r\ny typing, while in my handwriting I  use all the features of Senior Quikscr=\r\nipt. So this ended up being a bit of a compromise: Junior Quikscript seems =\r\nbetter suited to typing; but at the same time, I got used to how the letter=\r\ns neatly nest together in handwriting, so I created hundreds of kerning pai=\r\nrs in the font so that would happen at least most of the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I personally have no experience with conversion utilit=\r\nies. I was curious about Adapt-It but never got around to trying it out.&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Enjoy,&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;Scott&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;sig4325065&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;signat=\r\nure&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;signature&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Scott Ellsworth=\r\n -- phone 415-621-6148&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;----- Original message -----&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Fro=\r\nm: &quot;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:trybloganatgmail@...&quot;&gt;trybloganatgmail@...=\r\nm&lt;/a&gt; [Read_Alphabet]&quot; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com&quot;=\r\n&gt;Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;To: &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto=\r\n:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;Subject: Re: [Read_Alphabet] new course for MemRise; new decks for AN=\r\nKI&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Date: 29 Sep 2015 11:49:50 -0700&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Yes, than=\r\nk you. &nbsp;I myself don&#39;t understand the conflict with Shavian Script. &n=\r\nbsp;It is attractive, but it does not have all the dips and swoops that mak=\r\ne QuickScript easier (in my mind) to read and write. &nbsp;But, what do I k=\r\nnow?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;position: relative; font-family: Arial, helvet=\r\nica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;z-index: 1; line-he=\r\night: 1.22em;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: Georgia; line-height: 1.22em;&quot;&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-height: 1=\r\n.22em;&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve looking at the several fonts available at the site. &nbsp;Each=\r\n one has particular strengths. &nbsp;Suave (swxv) appears to meet my needs =\r\nin an American font. &nbsp;However, there does not appear to be an &quot;aw&quot; let=\r\nter, unless &quot;ox&quot; in American English is close enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em;&quot;&gt;=\r\nEveryone has their personal reasons for preferring one or another. &nbsp;I =\r\nmight try to do without half letters and with fewer ligatures for the time =\r\nbeing, as Ellsworth recommends. &nbsp;And eventually, I&#39;ll see what happens=\r\n to my reading ability. &nbsp;If you know how to contact him, please let me=\r\n know. &nbsp;I&#39;ve got questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22e=\r\nm;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em;&quot;&gt;For some perhaps minor=\r\n reason, Suave--out of all fonts I&#39;ve looked at--appears to look most like =\r\nphonetic English if converted to Ariel or whatever. &nbsp;A little minor se=\r\narch and replaces in LibreOffice, and I&#39;m pretty good to go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.2=\r\n2em;&quot;&gt;One other item: &nbsp;Is it possible to find the source code for that=\r\n wonderful QS_Converter? &nbsp;Are the Perl Scripts in another folder relat=\r\ned? &nbsp;This brings up an interesting question for me. &nbsp;How well cou=\r\nld it convert from QS back to English? &nbsp; What percentage of errors wou=\r\nld I find?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;=\r\n\n\r\n--_----------=_144356905731852123--\r\n\n"
