  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1934834866\">I have uploaded my unicode version of Kingsley to the Fonts folder. <br/>\nThis is still a work in progress, but I fear if I keep sitting on it<br/>\nthe project will get buried under other (paying) work that I am doing.<br/>\n Notably, while the font works on both Mac OS and Windows (hopefully<br/>\nLinux too), the kerning does not seem to work on Windows 2000.  Can<br/>\nsomeone using XP tell me how it looks?  You might want to try a few<br/>\nprograms, because comments on the FontForge list indicate that the<br/>\nkerning will work in some (Adobe) programs and not others (Microsoft).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to actually see characters in the font, you will need to<br/>\neither enter them yourself (not easy, since they are all Unicode<br/>\npoints), or use one of the keylayouts I uploaded (Mac only), or<br/>\ndownload the &quot;QS_unicode_sample.txt&quot; file that I have also uploaded.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I generated this copy of the .ttf, I have changed a few other<br/>\nthings about the font, namely normalizing the character spacing.  This<br/>\nin turn screwed up all the kerning that I had worked to fix, and I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t gone through the process of re-fixing it, so this version is<br/>\nthe most publicly-consumable at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do, however, have the FontForge .sfd file, if someone is interested<br/>\nin playing with that.  Indeed, I would love to have some more pairs of<br/>\neyes looking at it: I can not quite figure out how to encode glyph<br/>\nalternates: I don&#39;t know create glyphs that are not encoded at<br/>\nspecific Unicode points, nor can I get named classes of characters<br/>\nworking.  In fact, FontForge crashes on me if I try to create named<br/>\nclasses: this happens on Mac OS X and Windows (under cygwin), and it<br/>\nhappens with other fonts as well, so it is not a Kingsley problem.  I<br/>\nbelieve the alternate characters can be defined using the &#39;subs&#39; &#39;alt<br/>\nsubs&#39; and &#39;mult subs&#39; sections under the Glyph Info dialog; and thence<br/>\nI think the when-to-use-which-alternate-characters decision is made in<br/>\nthe &#39;contextual&#39; section under Font Info... but I haven&#39;t really<br/>\nfigured it all out yet.   The FontForge documentation is terse. <br/>\nTrying to create new substitutions is also crashing for me.<br/>\n<br/>\noliver</div>",
