I was originally quite fond of the idea of establishing IPA values for QS letters.  I find the QM table utterly baffling in the 32-33-34 range.  I pronounce &quot;calm,&quot; &quot;haul&quot;, and &quot;on&quot; all pretty much the same way, but &quot;Ah&quot; and &quot;Awe&quot; completely differently.  When I pronounce &quot;Ox&quot; I sometimes think it&#39;s different than &quot;Ah,&quot; but it&#39;s not much different.  How can I make any sense of the distinctions in Read&#39;s table then?  Having IPA values would solve this.\n\nHere&#39;s where I get into some trouble though, and it involves a quick story.  I was at an Esperanto meetup in Durham, NC a few years back.  We had a fellow Esperantist visiting from New Zealand.  He told us that he found the North Carolina accent completely opaque, and that North Carolinians were completely unable to understand him.  (I have to confirm that I found his English darn near incomprehensible, although he understood mine well enough -- I have more of a mid-Atlantic accent.)  Fortunately, we were all able to communicate in Esperanto without any difficulty.  \n\nThe thing is: what if he and I were trying to communicate in QS?  If we wrote QS phonetically, I expect we would completely fail at communication.  His writing would be as incomprehensible to me as his speech.  However, with a more regularized spelling, written communication between North Carolina and New Zealand becomes possible again. \n\nThis goes, then, to how I solve my 32-33-34 problem with QS.  I basically have no distinction in my speech between Ah (32) and Ox (34).  When a word is spelled with an &quot;o&quot; in T.O., I use &quot;Ox.&quot;  When it is spelled with anything other than an &quot;o&quot; in T.O, then I use &quot;Ah.&quot;  Well, not exactly.  When the &quot;o&quot; is the schwa sound, I use &quot;Utter.&quot;   I think this is perfectly in line with KR&#39;s approach with Roe -- Where there is ambiguity in dialectical pronunciation, then QS defaults to the closest obvious mapping to T.O.  \n\nSo, at the end of the day -- I don&#39;t think an IPA mapping is a good idea.  Rather, a set of dialect-specific minimal pairs with some rules for resolving ambiguities in favor of approximating T.O. is probably the best way to capture the phoneme distinctions that KR was trying to get at, while facilitating effective communication among those with divergent dialects.  \n\nThanks,\nDelRayVA\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
