  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-64874868\">There are several reasons for going back to the original languages, you can decide if they hold any water :) <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first one is that English has traditionally based itself on Latin for Biblical names. Latin, and Greek before it, are terrible at writing Hebrew (and Aramaic, we are talking about the New Testament too) while Quikscript can accurately depict it (with the exception of the letter Ayin, which is commonly pronounced as a glottal stop anyway). This version of the Bible is aimed at everyone, not just those who are familiar with the traditional spellings and post-great-vowel-shift pronunciations. It also changes most of the Greek names, since Latin had to change them as well to fit its reduced vowel inventory.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the change is too drastic, once all the typos and homographs are taken care of, the project can easily be forked (hooray open source!) and changed accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as will have to be said for quite some time with the massive book that the Bible is, this is a work in progress. If anyone wants to join the team, it would be wonderful. If another project to, say, put the classics into Quikscript completes a work first, that would be excellent as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;raghaillaigh&quot; &lt;vin.reilly@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tim,<br/>\n&gt; is the book of Mark from the Hebrew Names Edition of WEB?
