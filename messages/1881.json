Five of the six RP &#39;lax&#39; vowel phonemes are<br/>\n&gt;  readily associated to five of the six TO vowel-<br/>\n&gt;  letters, and thus the Quikscript letters for those<br/>\n&gt;  phonemes have been mapped to the lower-case forms of<br/>\n&gt;  those associated letters: #26 = {i}, #28 = {e}, #30 =<br/>\n&gt;  {a}, #34 = {o}, #39 = {u}, and the sixth RP &#39;lax&#39; vowel<br/>\n&gt;  phoneme /V/, and its Quikscript letter #36 -- which<br/>\n&gt;  also is paired with a &#39;looped&#39; letter #37 -- has been<br/>\n&gt;  mapped to the sixth TO vowel letter {y}.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Next we assign the Quikscript letters which are paired<br/>\n&gt;  with the Quikscript letters assigned to the TO lower-<br/>\n&gt;  case vowel-letters to the corresponding TO upper-case<br/>\n&gt;  vowel-letters. Some of these mappings make no<br/>\n&gt;  &#39;phonetic&#39; sense; rather one has to remember the<br/>\n&gt;  mapping of lower-case TO vowel-letters to Quikscript<br/>\n&gt;  letters, and then the rule that the Quikscript letters<br/>\n&gt;  paired with these letters are assigned to the<br/>\n&gt;  corresponding TO upper- case letters: 27 - I, 29 - E,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ### Some problematic assignments<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  We then come to the seventh Quikscript vowel letter<br/>\n&gt;  pair #32-#33. They are problematic, since there are no<br/>\n&gt;  TO vowel letters readily available for them. I choose<br/>\n&gt;  to assign them to the one TO upper-lower-case letter-<br/>\n&gt;  pair not readily associated with any English phoneme,<br/>\n&gt;  namely _Q-q_. This does not mean that there are no<br/>\n&gt;  memory-cues available for these mappings: Quikscript<br/>\n&gt;  letter #33 can be seen as a shape variation of<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript letter #34, and the TO upper-case _Q_ is of<br/>\n&gt;  course visually similar to a TO upper-case _O_, and,<br/>\n&gt;  likewise Quikscript letter ##32 can be seen as a shape<br/>\n&gt;  variation of Quikscript letter ##30, and TO lower- case<br/>\n&gt;  _q_ is -- admittedly vaguely -- similar to a TO lower-<br/>\n&gt;  case script _a_.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Last we come the unpaired Quikscript vowel-letter ##38.<br/>\n&gt;  It&#39;s sound is usually associated with the TO letter<br/>\n&gt;  _o_, or one of the digraphs _oa, ou_ or _ow_ which all<br/>\n&gt;  contain _o_, but due to my choosen system for assigning<br/>\n&gt;  the &#39;paired&#39; Quikscript vowel- letters to TO letters<br/>\n&gt;  _o_ and _O_ are already occupied by Quikscript letters<br/>\n&gt;  #34-#35. Quikscript letter #38 must therefore be<br/>\n&gt;  assigned to the otherwise unused TO letter upper-case<br/>\n&gt;  _B_, which at least allows us to use the words &quot;bowl&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  and &quot;bow&quot; (the noun), which recall the shape of the<br/>\n&gt;  letter in the Quikscript Manual, as memory-cues. I<br/>\n&gt;  readily admit, however that this is the weakest point<br/>\n&gt;  of my proposal: if one finds the system for assigning<br/>\n&gt;  the other vowels an advantage in favor of my proposal<br/>\n&gt;  one will simply have to take this weakness in the<br/>\n&gt;  bargain! It was tempting to assign Quikscript letter<br/>\n&gt;  #38 to the ASCII @ symbol, but I preferred to assign<br/>\n&gt;  all the Quikscript letters which are sanctioned by the<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript Manual to Traditional Orthography upper- or<br/>\n&gt;  lower- case letters leaving the ASCII symbol characters<br/>\n&gt;  alone, and the namer dot to the &#39;back-tick&#39; {`} which<br/>\n&gt;  is superfluous in normal typing, pace TeX.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ### Consonants<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  There are few innovations among the primary consonants,<br/>\n&gt;  since the majority of Quikscript consonant letters have<br/>\n&gt;  an obvious one-to-one counterpart in Traditional<br/>\n&gt;  Orthography. Most of the remaining have been assigned<br/>\n&gt;  them to the upper-case version of the letters for the<br/>\n&gt;  most similar sounds already assigned to a lower-case<br/>\n&gt;  letter, and I think few will argue against the<br/>\n&gt;  assignments #7 = {T}, #8 = {D}, #13 = {S}, #14 = {Z},<br/>\n&gt;  nor with the assignment of #15 to lower-case {c}, where<br/>\n&gt;  the added complication of having to press the shift key<br/>\n&gt;  seemed unwarranted. One might have preferred mapping<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript letter #13 to TO upper-case _C_ and<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript letter #14 to TO upper-case _J_, but the<br/>\n&gt;  system of vowel-assignments has already preempted the<br/>\n&gt;  pair {y}-{Y} for use as vowels, so that TO lower-case<br/>\n&gt;  _j_ had to be assigned to Quikscript letter #17, making<br/>\n&gt;  it necessary to assign Quikscript letter #16 to TO<br/>\n&gt;  upper-case _J_, in spite of this being a step away from<br/>\n&gt;  native speaker-writer&#39;s intuitions about TO letter-to-<br/>\n&gt;  sound correspondances. At least it agrees with the old<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript font mapping.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The reassignment -- in fact swapping -- of the<br/>\n&gt;  assignments of _G_ and _N_ may be a cause for concern<br/>\n&gt;  for those used to &#39;traditional&#39; Quikscript fonts, but I<br/>\n&gt;  think it is warranted: the TO spelling _ng_ at least<br/>\n&gt;  contains a _g_, while words like _now, knack, knife,<br/>\n&gt;  need_ -- the the Quikscript Manual examples of initial<br/>\n&gt;  alternate #23 -- don&#39;t, making transcriptions like<br/>\n&gt;  {loGiG, NY, Nak, NAf, NId} more readibly recognizable<br/>\n&gt;  than *{loNiN, GY, Gak, GAf, GId}. I&#39;m prepared to back<br/>\n&gt;  down on this point, however.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ## Benct Philip Jonsson&#39;s Quikscript key mapping<br/>\n&gt;  proposal No. 2<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I have been considering a different arrangement which<br/>\n&gt;  would allow the assignment of Quikscript letter #17 to<br/>\n&gt;  _y_ and other differences which would allow memory-cues<br/>\n&gt;  which are perhaps more intuitive in terms of native<br/>\n&gt;  speakers&#39; and writers&#39; expectations of TO sound-to-<br/>\n&gt;  letter correspondences, though upper-case _B_ would<br/>\n&gt;  still be assigned to a vowel (and now memory-cued to<br/>\n&gt;  the word &quot;bough&quot;, which unfortunately is pronounced<br/>\n&gt;  /bQf/--/bAf/ as a family name!), and Quikscript letter<br/>\n&gt;  #36 will be mapped to an ASCII non-letter (though an<br/>\n&gt;  unshifted keyboard position on American and British<br/>\n&gt;  keyboards).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ### Assignments which differ between BPJ 1 and BPJ 2<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  | QS # | (Jerome) | Name | BPJ 1 | BPJ 2 |<br/>\n&gt;  |-------|----------|------------- |---------|---------|<br/>\n&gt;  | #14 | (Z) | J&#39;ai | Z | J * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #16 | (J) | Jay | J | j * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #17 | (j) | Ye | j | y * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #31 | (F) | I | A * | Y * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #32 | (y) | Ah | q * | A * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #34 | (o) | Ox | o | o |<br/>\n&gt;  | #35 | (q) | Oy | O * | q |<br/>\n&gt;  | #36 | (a) | Utter | y * | ` * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #37 | (Q) | Out | Y * | B * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #38 | (O) | Owe | B * | O |<br/>\n&gt;  | - | (/) | naming dot | ` * | ^ * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #12.5 | (L) | half-Zoo | C * | Z * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #17.5 | (^) | half-Ye * | ^ | C * |<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  These changes do in fact amount to a different<br/>\n&gt;  proposal, since it no longer includes the &#39;Quikscript-<br/>\n&gt;  internal&#39; &#39;paired&#39; vowel-letter assignments.

Five of the six RP &#39;lax&#39; vowel phonemes are\n&gt;  readily=\r\n associated to five of the six TO vowel-\n&gt;  letters, and thus the Quikscrip=\r\nt letters for those\n&gt;  phonemes have been mapped to the lower-case forms of=\r\n\n&gt;  those associated letters: #26 =3D {i}, #28 =3D {e}, #30 =3D\n&gt;  {a}, #34=\r\n =3D {o}, #39 =3D {u}, and the sixth RP &#39;lax&#39; vowel\n&gt;  phoneme /V/, and its=\r\n Quikscript letter #36 -- which\n&gt;  also is paired with a &#39;looped&#39; letter #3=\r\n7 -- has been\n&gt;  mapped to the sixth TO vowel letter {y}.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Next we assi=\r\ngn the Quikscript letters which are paired\n&gt;  with the Quikscript letters a=\r\nssigned to the TO lower-\n&gt;  case vowel-letters to the corresponding TO uppe=\r\nr-case\n&gt;  vowel-letters. Some of these mappings make no\n&gt;  &#39;phonetic&#39; sense=\r\n; rather one has to remember the\n&gt;  mapping of lower-case TO vowel-letters =\r\nto Quikscript\n&gt;  letters, and then the rule that the Quikscript letters\n&gt;  =\r\npaired with these letters are assigned to the\n&gt;  corresponding TO upper- ca=\r\nse letters: 27 - I, 29 - E,\n&gt;\n&gt;  ### Some problematic assignments\n&gt;\n&gt;  We t=\r\nhen come to the seventh Quikscript vowel letter\n&gt;  pair #32-#33. They are p=\r\nroblematic, since there are no\n&gt;  TO vowel letters readily available for th=\r\nem. I choose\n&gt;  to assign them to the one TO upper-lower-case letter-\n&gt;  pa=\r\nir not readily associated with any English phoneme,\n&gt;  namely _Q-q_. This d=\r\noes not mean that there are no\n&gt;  memory-cues available for these mappings:=\r\n Quikscript\n&gt;  letter #33 can be seen as a shape variation of\n&gt;  Quikscript=\r\n letter #34, and the TO upper-case _Q_ is of\n&gt;  course visually similar to =\r\na TO upper-case _O_, and,\n&gt;  likewise Quikscript letter ##32 can be seen as=\r\n a shape\n&gt;  variation of Quikscript letter ##30, and TO lower- case\n&gt;  _q_ =\r\nis -- admittedly vaguely -- similar to a TO lower-\n&gt;  case script _a_.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n Last we come the unpaired Quikscript vowel-letter ##38.\n&gt;  It&#39;s sound is u=\r\nsually associated with the TO letter\n&gt;  _o_, or one of the digraphs _oa, ou=\r\n_ or _ow_ which all\n&gt;  contain _o_, but due to my choosen system for assign=\r\ning\n&gt;  the &#39;paired&#39; Quikscript vowel- letters to TO letters\n&gt;  _o_ and _O_ =\r\nare already occupied by Quikscript letters\n&gt;  #34-#35. Quikscript letter #3=\r\n8 must therefore be\n&gt;  assigned to the otherwise unused TO letter upper-cas=\r\ne\n&gt;  _B_, which at least allows us to use the words &quot;bowl&quot;\n&gt;  and &quot;bow&quot; (th=\r\ne noun), which recall the shape of the\n&gt;  letter in the Quikscript Manual, =\r\nas memory-cues. I\n&gt;  readily admit, however that this is the weakest point\n=\r\n&gt;  of my proposal: if one finds the system for assigning\n&gt;  the other vowel=\r\ns an advantage in favor of my proposal\n&gt;  one will simply have to take this=\r\n weakness in the\n&gt;  bargain! It was tempting to assign Quikscript letter\n&gt; =\r\n #38 to the ASCII @ symbol, but I preferred to assign\n&gt;  all the Quikscript=\r\n letters which are sanctioned by the\n&gt;  Quikscript Manual to Traditional Or=\r\nthography upper- or\n&gt;  lower- case letters leaving the ASCII symbol charact=\r\ners\n&gt;  alone, and the namer dot to the &#39;back-tick&#39; {`} which\n&gt;  is superflu=\r\nous in normal typing, pace TeX.\n&gt;\n&gt;  ### Consonants\n&gt;\n&gt;  There are few inno=\r\nvations among the primary consonants,\n&gt;  since the majority of Quikscript c=\r\nonsonant letters have\n&gt;  an obvious one-to-one counterpart in Traditional\n&gt;=\r\n  Orthography. Most of the remaining have been assigned\n&gt;  them to the uppe=\r\nr-case version of the letters for the\n&gt;  most similar sounds already assign=\r\ned to a lower-case\n&gt;  letter, and I think few will argue against the\n&gt;  ass=\r\nignments #7 =3D {T}, #8 =3D {D}, #13 =3D {S}, #14 =3D {Z},\n&gt;  nor with the =\r\nassignment of #15 to lower-case {c}, where\n&gt;  the added complication of hav=\r\ning to press the shift key\n&gt;  seemed unwarranted. One might have preferred =\r\nmapping\n&gt;  Quikscript letter #13 to TO upper-case _C_ and\n&gt;  Quikscript let=\r\nter #14 to TO upper-case _J_, but the\n&gt;  system of vowel-assignments has al=\r\nready preempted the\n&gt;  pair {y}-{Y} for use as vowels, so that TO lower-cas=\r\ne\n&gt;  _j_ had to be assigned to Quikscript letter #17, making\n&gt;  it necessar=\r\ny to assign Quikscript letter #16 to TO\n&gt;  upper-case _J_, in spite of this=\r\n being a step away from\n&gt;  native speaker-writer&#39;s intuitions about TO lett=\r\ner-to-\n&gt;  sound correspondances. At least it agrees with the old\n&gt;  Quikscr=\r\nipt font mapping.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The reassignment -- in fact swapping -- of the\n&gt;  as=\r\nsignments of _G_ and _N_ may be a cause for concern\n&gt;  for those used to &#39;t=\r\nraditional&#39; Quikscript fonts, but I\n&gt;  think it is warranted: the TO spelli=\r\nng _ng_ at least\n&gt;  contains a _g_, while words like _now, knack, knife,\n&gt; =\r\n need_ -- the the Quikscript Manual examples of initial\n&gt;  alternate #23 --=\r\n don&#39;t, making transcriptions like\n&gt;  {loGiG, NY, Nak, NAf, NId} more readi=\r\nbly recognizable\n&gt;  than *{loNiN, GY, Gak, GAf, GId}. I&#39;m prepared to back\n=\r\n&gt;  down on this point, however.\n&gt;\n&gt;  ## Benct Philip Jonsson&#39;s Quikscript k=\r\ney mapping\n&gt;  proposal No. 2\n&gt;\n&gt;  I have been considering a different arran=\r\ngement which\n&gt;  would allow the assignment of Quikscript letter #17 to\n&gt;  _=\r\ny_ and other differences which would allow memory-cues\n&gt;  which are perhaps=\r\n more intuitive in terms of native\n&gt;  speakers&#39; and writers&#39; expectations o=\r\nf TO sound-to-\n&gt;  letter correspondences, though upper-case _B_ would\n&gt;  st=\r\nill be assigned to a vowel (and now memory-cued to\n&gt;  the word &quot;bough&quot;, whi=\r\nch unfortunately is pronounced\n&gt;  /bQf/--/bAf/ as a family name!), and Quik=\r\nscript letter\n&gt;  #36 will be mapped to an ASCII non-letter (though an\n&gt;  un=\r\nshifted keyboard position on American and British\n&gt;  keyboards).\n&gt;\n&gt;  ### A=\r\nssignments which differ between BPJ 1 and BPJ 2\n&gt;\n&gt;  | QS # | (Jerome) | Na=\r\nme | BPJ 1 | BPJ 2 |\n&gt;  |-------|----------|------------- |---------|------=\r\n---|\n&gt;  | #14 | (Z) | J&#39;ai | Z | J * |\n&gt;  | #16 | (J) | Jay | J | j * |\n&gt;  =\r\n| #17 | (j) | Ye | j | y * |\n&gt;  | #31 | (F) | I | A * | Y * |\n&gt;  | #32 | (y=\r\n) | Ah | q * | A * |\n&gt;  | #34 | (o) | Ox | o | o |\n&gt;  | #35 | (q) | Oy | O =\r\n* | q |\n&gt;  | #36 | (a) | Utter | y * | ` * |\n&gt;  | #37 | (Q) | Out | Y * | B=\r\n * |\n&gt;  | #38 | (O) | Owe | B * | O |\n&gt;  | - | (/) | naming dot | ` * | ^ *=\r\n |\n&gt;  | #12.5 | (L) | half-Zoo | C * | Z * |\n&gt;  | #17.5 | (^) | half-Ye * |=\r\n ^ | C * |\n&gt;\n&gt;  These changes do in fact amount to a different\n&gt;  proposal,=\r\n since it no longer includes the &#39;Quikscript-\n&gt;  internal&#39; &#39;paired&#39; vowel-l=\r\netter assignments.
