If it is clear what the word is then you have found an <br/>\nacceptable solution.

If the <br/>\nletters are carefully formed, however, there is a shift in the curve <br/>\nfrom &quot;day&quot; to &quot;eat&quot; (concave to convex viewed from the end of the word) <br/>\nwhich should make it apparent what the letters are.  If there is any <br/>\ndoubt, a small &quot;step&quot; as suggested in the QS man. could be used to <br/>\nseparate the two letters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that a &quot;style guide&quot; for printed text would be different <br/>\nthan one intended for handwriting.  The latter should permit more <br/>\nflexibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the use of abbreviations:  I have no idea what &quot;YMMV&quot; is <br/>\nsupposed to mean, pointing out the danger to communication that <br/>\nabbreviations can cause.  I might think it a Roman numeral except that <br/>\n&quot;Y&quot; isn&#39;t one :-)  Only if an abbreviation is in wide-spread use with <br/>\nan  unequivocal meaning would it be safe to use.  Otherwise, it just <br/>\nslows the reader down or brings him to a halt while he ponders the <br/>\nmeaning of some unfamiliar abbreviation, and for what -- the savings of <br/>\na few pen or key strokes.  In other words, an unknown abbreviation, <br/>\ncauses the very opposite of its intention -- instead of saving time for <br/>\nboth writer and reader, it only saves the writer&#39;s time and hinders <br/>\ncommunication with the reader.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaige<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\namd64_hacker wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; [snip]<br/>\n&gt; Personally I&#39;m for abbreviations in all texts.<br/>\n&gt; It seems to me that since QS is meant to be &#39;heard&#39; it shouldn&#39;t matter<br/>\n&gt; how the word is written but how it is read.<br/>\n&gt; As you said it&#39;s personal, so YMMV.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; About half height letters, I have to agree that they are part of what<br/>\n&gt; makes QS look so pretty on paper.<br/>\n&gt; The trouble is which combinations to use, obviously a half height TEA<br/>\n&gt; followed by IT is out of the question, but which other combinations<br/>\n&gt; should be avoided?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also what do you do when you have several alternative ways of writing a<br/>\n&gt; word?<br/>\n&gt; Take for example the word &#39;indy&#39;: IT, NO, DAY, EAT (I think I have that<br/>\n&gt; right).<br/>\n&gt; You can write it using only the normal forms so that you join the IT,<br/>\n&gt; NO, DAY at their tops.<br/>\n&gt; Or you can use the alternate NO and half height DAY and join them all at<br/>\n&gt; the bottom.<br/>\n&gt; Also do you join DAY and EAT in either case?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again this is a personal thing but perhaps a few rules of thumb could be<br/>\n&gt; thrashed out?
