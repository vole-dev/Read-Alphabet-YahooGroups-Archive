  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2055963923\">Dear Anthony,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m having trouble seeing how to work a strictly phonetic approach in real life even within my own writing.  My family and I discussed recently the different pronunciations  of the &quot;t&quot; in &quot;train&quot; that we have among us.  The difference is that sometimes TOT is used, and sometimes CHURCH is used.  Listening to myself carefully in this and similar words, I find that most of the time I use TOT, but on occasion I will start this word with CHURCH.  Should I write the exact same word differently depending on which pronunciation I use in a particular context?  Certainly not, since I intend the same phoneme in each context.  Writing this word phonetically just introduces confusion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOther consonant problems are one of emphasis.  When I want to emphasize the word &quot;Matter,&quot; I will use TOT in the middle of it.  When I am not emphasizing the word, I use &quot;DEAD&quot; in the middle of it.  Should I spell the same word differently depending on whether I am emphasizing it?  I hardly think so.  (Just as a note -- I use DEAD in the middle of &quot;Matters&quot; almost exclusively, even when emphasizing it.)  In each case, the same phoneme is communicated, even if they are phonetically distinct.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s been much discussion about vowels in this topic -- I think because vowels in English convey relatively less information than consonants do.  However, adopting a phonetic approach causes countless painful issues in relation to consonants as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, has anyone else noticed that Read uses THITHER instead of THOTH in the words &quot;with&quot; and &quot;without&quot; on page 11 of QM?  Is this really the way he pronounced these words?  I can&#39;t even get my mouth to form that sound in the middle of &quot;without.&quot;  Of course, that might explain why he needed an abbreviation for &quot;with&quot; when WOW-IT-THOTH is so easy to write.  I don&#39;t think this observation helps my argument at all, but it is an interesting point to consider as we discuss this.  I guess I do use THITHER in the middle of &quot;within,&quot; but never in &quot;without.&quot;  If I followed a strictly phonetic approach, I&#39;d be spelling these two obviously related words with different consonants and increasing confusion.  Instead, I think they should both be constructed using however I spell &quot;with&quot; -- in this case WOW-IT-THOTH -- combined with the appropriate suffixes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nGreg<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Anthony Grahn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:othermale@...\">othermale@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSent: Sunday, November 4, 2007 8:57:26 AM<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: [Read_Alphabet] Re: Lexical sets and QS letters<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                              Here&#39;s my main objection in a nutshell:<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n - Kingsley spells &quot;path&quot; with #32 Ah and &quot;as&quot; with #30 At<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n - Most Americans spell both &quot;path&quot; and &quot;as&quot; with #30 At<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n If we must all now use #32 for the word &quot;path&quot; while still using<br/>\n<br/>\n #30 for &quot;as&quot; it would be problem enough.
