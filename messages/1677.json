Nearly everyone hears a difference<br> in these letters and yet must hesitate when writing to decide which to\n<br> use. The problem is even worse for those who have the F sound for TH<br> and now must figure out which letter to use for a sound they don&#39;t<br> have. But the advantage of having two letters appears to be small: I\n<br> suspect that reading would not be hindered if only one such letter<br> existed for both. And a visually ambiguity between They vs She has<br> been mentioned which can not be helping reading.<br><br> For Ooze vs Foot the same issue exists: writing is encumbered for a\n<br> small benefit to reading apperantly.<br><br> And again for Way vs Why. <br><br> Ox vs Awe vs Ah: thanks to lexical sets, there should theoretically be<br> less confusion for those who merge some or all of those sounds yet\n<br> clearly they still cause a great deal of conversation. And for these<br> there are difficulties beyond just slowing writing. Yet the benefits<br> of having a three part division seem only to be aesthetic and then<br>\n only for certian accents.<br><br> Then there are other letters that have very specialized use: Loch and<br> LLan never appear in any English word and so can only be used for<br> Scottish and Welsh place names. But why only add these sounds? There\n<br> are several places where Anglophones live integrated with<br> non-Anglophones. Should then there not be a battery of French vowels<br> in QS for Quebec place names and likewise Nunavut sounds for names in<br> northern Canada. And sounds for Aboriginal Australian place names and\n<br> Native American Indian place names?<br><br> Without raising the issue of changing QS I&#39;d put the question thus: if<br> a new writing system for English were being composed, would it include<br> this particular set of letters?\n<br><br> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet%40yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a>, Benct Philip Jonsson <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bpj@...\">\n&lt;bpj@...&gt;</a><br> wrote:<br> &gt;<br> &gt; All of you discussing how to adapt QS to<br> &gt; different accents should make sure to read<br> &gt; this article:<br> &gt; <br> &gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/accents_spellingreform.htm\">\nhttp://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/accents_spellingreform.htm</a>&gt;<br> &gt; <br> &gt; /BP 8^)&gt;<br> &gt; --<br> &gt; Benct Philip Jonsson -- melroch atte melroch dotte se<br> &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<br> &gt; &quot;C&#39;est en vain que nos Josu\u00c3&copy;s litt\u00c3&copy;raires crient<br> &gt; \u00c3 la langue de s&#39;arr\u00c3\u00aater; les langues ni le soleil<br> &gt; ne s&#39;arr\u00c3\u00aatent plus.
