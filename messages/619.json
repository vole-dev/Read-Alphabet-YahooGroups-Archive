It is shown in all religion, from the Celtic to<br/>\nChristianaty and is obviously manifest in the city based society<br/>\ntoday. Standardized spelling has been instutionalized as one more<br/>\nthing to keep in order, and it is very likely that it will be passed<br/>\nfrom parents and teachers to children.

If people start speaking the way they read, which is quite<br/>\npossible through the whole sub-vocalization process that people do<br/>\nwhen reading, then what they read the most may change their own<br/>\nspeech, and in turn change their friends&#39; speech, etc. (Was that<br/>\napostraphe right? Stupid bloody possesive plurals...) making, most<br/>\nlikely, the western US accent go almost worldwide.
