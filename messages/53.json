  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1891591592\">Welcome to all new members of the group and hello again to those who <br/>\nhave been members for awhile.  Life has not left me much time in <br/>\nrecent months to do much with Read_Alphabet.  I am trying to correct <br/>\nthat to some degree now.  I am still having a little trouble with my <br/>\ne-mail -- my network at my office is not currently operational -- so <br/>\ndo not despair if I do not respond to an e-mail as quickly as you <br/>\nwould have liked.  I will respond eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been using Read&#39;s Alphabet, AKA Quikscript,for roughly 26 <br/>\nyears.  I have only had an e-mail from one other person who has been <br/>\naware of the alphabet for that length of time, and he seems to <br/>\nalternate between Read&#39;s Alphabet and Shavian.  If you or anyone you <br/>\nknow of has been using it for an extended period of time, let us hear <br/>\nfrom you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a firm believer in the utility of Read&#39;s Alphabet as well as its <br/>\nviability as an alternative alphabet that could help people in their <br/>\ndaily lives just as Kingsley Read suggested in the Quikscript Manual.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little background on myself:  I am an attorney in private practice, <br/>\nwho considers himself semi-computer literate.  By this I mean I am <br/>\nnot knowledgable about specialized areas of computer science, such as <br/>\ndesigning fonts from scratch.  On the other hand, I am not afraid to <br/>\nopen up my CPU to add hardware, and I remember what a DOS command <br/>\nis.  Hence, the semi-literate designation.  I bring this up because <br/>\nthere are computer skills that I do not have, nor do I have the time <br/>\nto learn them in the near future, that would greatly enhance this <br/>\nsite.  I do not doubt there are people in this group who already <br/>\npossess some of these skills and who, with a modest investment of <br/>\ntime, could help us to turn this site into an attractive spot to <br/>\nattract more Read&#39;s Alphabet users.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo give you some idea of what I am talking about:  Here are several <br/>\nthings I would like to see appear on this site.<br/>\n1.  A copy of the Quikscript manual.  It is not copyrighted so there <br/>\nis no legal prohibition I am aware of that would prevent us from <br/>\nposting it.<br/>\n2.  Texts written in Read&#39;s Alphabet.  These should be varying <br/>\nlengths and levels of complexity.  They could be original or copies <br/>\nof literary works in the public domain.<br/>\n3.  A practice area for people to write back and forth to each other <br/>\nin Read&#39;s Alphabet to gain experience in reading other people&#39;s <br/>\nscript.  I must admit that even after years of occasional use, I am <br/>\nnot as fluent at reading Read&#39;s Alphabet as I am at reading roman.  <br/>\nPractice makes perfect, after all.  I read roman everyday.  I cannot <br/>\nsay that about Read&#39;s Alphabet.  It is hard to get practice when the <br/>\nonly person that knows the script is yourself.  I know by experience, <br/>\nit is not easy to get casual acquaintances to learn Read&#39;s Alphabet, <br/>\nbut the internet gives us the chance to reach people from around the <br/>\nglobe who are intellectually curious.  The internet gives us an <br/>\ninexpensive platform that could spread the word to others.<br/>\n4.  Have all explanatory notes written in both roman and Read&#39;s <br/>\nAlphabet just as Androcles was printed in roman and Shavian.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor computer use we have the &quot;Jerome&quot; font, which was created about <br/>\nfifteen months ago.  I am excited about this as it gives us the <br/>\nopportunity to use the half-letters, which I found such an <br/>\ninteresting facet of Read&#39;s Alphabet in handwriting as they provide <br/>\nword shapes that are more distinctive than those written with the <br/>\nfull letters as in Junior Quikscript.  Jerome lets us use this <br/>\nfeature in internet correspondence and teaching.  Jerome also shows <br/>\nthat the letters can be joined in a &quot;cursive&quot; manner even <br/>\nin &quot;printing&quot; and remain graceful and attractive as opposed to the  <br/>\ndetached and stilted Shavian.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, Jerome was the work of a person new to computer <br/>\nfonts, and it is not perfect.  I am confident that someone familiar <br/>\nwith computer fonts could redesign Jerome to improve it and make it <br/>\neven easier to use while maintaining its basic style.  I believe some <br/>\nof the letters need additional work to bring them closer to their <br/>\nappearance in the Quikscript manual.  Another problem is that <br/>\nsometimes the cursor position does not appear where the next letter <br/>\nwill be inserted.  This can be confusing.  And why does it only <br/>\nhappen sometimes?  I think this problem is related to the use of half-<br/>\nletters, but I am not sure of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am interested in hearing your thoughts on this and any other <br/>\nmatters connected to the use and spread of Read&#39;s Alphabet.  Thanks <br/>\nfor taking the time to read this long post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaige Gabhart</div>",
