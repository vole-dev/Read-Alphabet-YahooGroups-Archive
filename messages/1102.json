  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-808612494\">Hi group,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to determine how much larger the tall and deep letters are<br/>\nthan the small letters. It seems that the Read manual makes the large<br/>\nletters double that of the smaller ones, but I&#39;m not sure. To test<br/>\nthis out, I make two large representations of the letters, one in<br/>\nwhich the large letters are about 1 1/2 times larger than the small<br/>\nones, and one in which the large ones are a full double size.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d appreciate as much feedback as possible to these two questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Which proportion looks the best in an ideal situation--where you<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to worry about space, for example when you are doing art<br/>\nwork on a wall or doing calligraphy.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Which proportion looks better in writing? Let&#39;s pretend that you<br/>\nhave a nice large sheet in front of you and you know that you are<br/>\ngoing to have to have a lot of line space for the larger letters, but<br/>\ntighter space for the smaller ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul</div>",
