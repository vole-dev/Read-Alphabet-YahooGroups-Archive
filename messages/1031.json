  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1948082628\">I am new to Quickscript, having discovered it only about two months ago. I&#39;ve managed to teach myself how to write in QS (or so it seems to me), but it would be a great help to have more examples to read. After reading the Quickscript Manual, I looked for other examples of written Quickscript. The main source that I have been using is the file &quot;QS_Dict_TextOnly.txt&quot; which is included in QsConverter_1_2_1.zip under Files &gt; QsConverter, for this Yahoo group. Since I don&#39;t use Windows, I could not use the converter itself, but I reformatted the file into a Rich Text Format document, which is nicely searchable. If anyone would like to see this file, I&#39;ve put it here:\n<br><br><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://staff.washington.edu/freeman/qs/qs_dict.rtf\">http://staff.washington.edu/freeman/qs/qs_dict.rtf</a><br><br>Instead of a periodical for writing in Quickscript, here is what I&#39;ve been wanting to create: a website, similar to the Babelfish website. The user could enter a URL, and the site would recast the page using Quickscript. This would be significantly easier than translation, and would mainly require a dictionary, preferably a current online dictionary with IPA pronunciations. The dictionary would need to be fast. Any suggestions?\n<br><br>I have one or two beginner&#39;s question. Having grown up speaking North American English in the area of the cot-caught merger, I have difficulty distinguishing between QS letters 32, 33, and 34. I&#39;ve noticed that the file &quot;QS_Dict_TextOnly.txt&quot; doesn&#39;t contain a single instance of letter 34, which puzzles me. I also have difficulty imagining using 33+25 for &quot;or&quot;; I would tend to write 38+25. I&#39;m happy to memorize a few combinations that don&#39;t correspond with my own pronunciation, but an extended set of examples would be helpful.\n<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Ted<br><br><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1948082628gmail_quote\">On 9/12/07, <b class=\"ygrps-yiv-1948082628gmail_sendername\">pgabhart</b> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pgabhart@...\">pgabhart@...</a>&gt; wrote:</span><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-1948082628gmail_quote\" style=\"border-left:1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\n\n\n<div style=\"width:655px;\">\n  <div style=\"padding:0pt 15px 0pt 0pt;width:490px;float:left;\">\n\n\n    <div>\n            <p>I noticed that in my recent post in which I wrote about the way an <br>\nalphabet was intended to work:  &quot;one sound = one phoneme.&quot;  Of course, I <br>\nmeant to write &quot;one symbol = one phoneme&quot;<br>\n<br>\nYour experience with /Faerie Queene /matches my expectation that <br>\noccasional aberrant spellings are not the end of the world.

Were someone to start a periodical in <br>\n&gt; Quickscript as discussed earlier, with contributors from varying <br>\n&gt; locations, it seems to me that the only concern for the materials <br>\n&gt; would be that they actually do match the spoken language, and are not <br>\n&gt; just errors made from thinking in traditional orthography.

The QS manual starts off with the reasons why trying to<br>\n&gt;     redesign the Roman alphabet just doesn&#39;t cut it. A new alphabet<br>\n&gt;     was needed.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;     The problem I see with standardized spelling is that the<br>\n&gt;     &quot;English-speaking Peoples&quot; have no language academy to even<br>\n&gt;     attempt to<br>\n&gt;     enforce spelling changes as the language continues to evolve. That is<br>\n&gt;     sort of how we got in this mess (TO) to begin with.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;     I may be abysmally ignorant of the extent of English dialects, but I<br>\n&gt;     suspect that for a very large majority of English speakers, i.e. the<br>\n&gt;     ones clustered in the middle of the bell curve of English<br>\n&gt;     pronunciation,<br>\n&gt;     we could get along just fine without a standardized spelling<br>\n&gt;     because the<br>\n&gt;     majority of the words we use on a daily basis are not going to be<br>\n&gt;     spelt<br>\n&gt;     so peculiarly by someone from a different, but still one of the major<br>\n&gt;     speech communities that it would not be recognizable. To be sure,<br>\n&gt;     there<br>\n&gt;     are the outliers on that bell curve who would need to conform their<br>\n&gt;     speech to a dialect in broader use than their own such as they would<br>\n&gt;     hear on the BBC or from American news outlets. But for most of us, I<br>\n&gt;     doubt we would need spelling police. For example, if I write<br>\n&gt;     &quot;schedule&quot;<br>\n&gt;     with a &quot;k&quot; sound, and a Londoner reads it, I seriously doubt, he<br>\n&gt;     would<br>\n&gt;     have more than a moment&#39;s hesitation in deciphering the word even<br>\n&gt;     though<br>\n&gt;     he doesn&#39;t pronounce it that way.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;     If we start insisting that every word must be spelt in accordance<br>\n&gt;     with<br>\n&gt;     an arbitrary standard that does not match anyone&#39;s speech completely,<br>\n&gt;     then we will be back to looking up many words and memorizing their<br>\n&gt;     spelling. It is my understanding that in Shakespeare&#39;s time, the idea<br>\n&gt;     of proper spelling did not exist, and the Bard was quite content to<br>\n&gt;     spell a word one way today and differently tomorrow. That apparently<br>\n&gt;     didn&#39;t hold him back We all have been prejudiced by our schooling and<br>\n&gt;     what Kingsley Read called the &quot;cultural fetish&quot; of spelling to reject<br>\n&gt;     the idea that we can spell words the way we want. If we go too far<br>\n&gt;     astray, our readers won&#39;t understand, and we pay the price of not<br>\n&gt;     being<br>\n&gt;     read. That by itself, forces a high level of conformism onto the<br>\n&gt;     situation, but to insist that we all have to spell in lockstep or be<br>\n&gt;     considered morons is quite a different matter.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;     I have seen a number of people insist that we have to have<br>\n&gt;     standardized<br>\n&gt;     spelling or we are doomed, but I doubt anyone has actually studied<br>\n&gt;     this<br>\n&gt;     so we have no real data as to how an alternative English alphabet<br>\n&gt;     would<br>\n&gt;     work if it did or did not use standardized spelling. For example, let<br>\n&gt;     us assume that we don&#39;t insist on standardized spelling and that<br>\n&gt;     it was<br>\n&gt;     later found that that decision slowed the average reading speed by<br>\n&gt;     5 or<br>\n&gt;     10 % (I doubt it would be any greater than that). Would that not be a<br>\n&gt;     reasonable price to pay to avoid putting ourselves back in the<br>\n&gt;     position<br>\n&gt;     of attempting to memorize how words should be spelt rather than<br>\n&gt;     spelling<br>\n&gt;     them the way they sound in speech? I believe it would, especially for<br>\n&gt;     the dyslexics among us, who cannot deal with arbitrary spellings.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;     If a person occasionally is unsure how to spell a word because he<br>\n&gt;     suspects he may pronounce it differently than others, he could always<br>\n&gt;     look it up in a dictionary. This is better than trying to memorize<br>\n&gt;     the<br>\n&gt;     spelling of virtually his entire vocabulary in order to have it<br>\n&gt;     comply<br>\n&gt;     with an arbitrary standard of speech.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;     Paige<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;     John Cowan wrote:<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; amd64_hacker scripsit:<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; Personally I&#39;m for abbreviations in all texts.<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; It seems to me that since QS is meant to be &#39;heard&#39; it<br>\n&gt;     shouldn&#39;t matter<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; how the word is written but how it is read.<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; Well, yes, but that slows down reading to the speed of speech. I<br>\n&gt;     suspect<br>\n&gt;     &gt; that rapid silent reading and standardized orthography go together --<br>\n&gt;     &gt; we do know that fluent readers recognize familiar words by the total<br>\n&gt;     &gt; shape of the word, slowing down only when they must to read an<br>\n&gt;     unfamilar<br>\n&gt;     &gt; word, and that this is equally true in languages that are rationally<br>\n&gt;     &gt; spelled, irrationally spelled, or not spelled at all (like Chinese).<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; So if QS is going to become important for works meant to be read<br>\n&gt;     &gt; more than once (as opposed to shorthand/transcription uses), a<br>\n&gt;     &gt; standardized orthography will have to evolve.<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; Which immediately leads to the issue of dialects. One&#39;s obvious and<br>\n&gt;     &gt; natural phonetic orthography is another&#39;s stumbling block. (&quot;Hmm,<br>\n&gt;     &gt; is it spelled &#39;theft&#39; or &#39;feft&#39;?&quot; &quot;Hmm, does this mean &#39;lord&#39; or<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &#39;laud&#39;?&quot;) A universal orthography ends up needing to make more<br>\n&gt;     &gt; distinctions<br>\n&gt;     &gt; than any one dialect actually needs, and thus to some extent becoming<br>\n&gt;     &gt; artificial to all.<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; --<br></span></div>\n&gt;     &gt; John Cowan <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cowan%40ccil.org\">cowan@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cowan%25\">\ncowan%</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">40ccil.org</a>&gt; &lt;mailto:<br>\n&gt;     cowan% &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cowan%25\">cowan%</a>25&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">40ccil.org</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">\nhttp://40ccil.org</a>&gt;&gt;<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1948082628q\"><br>\n&gt;     &gt; &quot;Mr. Lane, if you ever wish anything that I can do, all you will have<br>\n&gt;     &gt; to do will be to send me a telegram asking and it will be done.&quot;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &quot;Mr. Hearst, if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do<br>\n&gt;     &gt; anything, you can put the telegram down as a forgery.&quot;<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;  <br>\n<br>\n</span><p></p>\n    </div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1948082628q\">  \n\n    \n    <span style=\"color:white;\"></span>\n\n</span></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote></div><br>\n </span></blockquote></div>",
