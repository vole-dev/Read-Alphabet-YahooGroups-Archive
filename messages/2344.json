  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-40256790\">Glad to have you as a new member.<br/>\n<br/>\nI selected the name &quot;Read Alphabet&quot; when I started the group site as a result of what I perceived to be the dismissive attitude toward QS of many of those in the Shavian group at the time.  My memory is that another member of the Shavian group, who was also primarily interested in QS as I was, did not want to see a permanent split between the two groups and hoped that avoiding Read&#39;s name (Quikscript)for the revised Shavian might help avoid that consequence.  I acquiesced in that at the time, although now I wish I had not.  I doubt that Yahoogroups will let me rename the group now, and it has been Read&#39;s Alphabet for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaige Gabhart<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Zyggy2&quot; &lt;jayson@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello all, new member first post.
