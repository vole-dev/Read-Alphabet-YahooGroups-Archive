Which one should a foreign student of QS use: which<br/>\nEnglish accent is the right one to learn?<br/>\n<br/>\n- We have spent massive effort accommodating accents spoken by tiny<br/>\ngroups of English-As-First-Language speakers (there&#39;s a whole letter<br/>\njust for Welsh place names) but none at all to accommodate ESL<br/>\naccents. This even where a single accent  is used by millions (eg<br/>\nnative Spanish speakers). Would it not, from a purely rational<br/>\nstandpoint, make as much sense to accommodate at least a few of the<br/>\nnear billion ESL speakers world wide as to accommodate a few hundred<br/>\nthousand native English speakers with a rare vowel merger?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a>, Benct Philip Jonsson &lt;bpj@...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; You are making Wells&#39;s article injustice if you think it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; all about adapting English spelling to various ESL<br/>\n&gt; minorities&#39; pronunciations or abolishing all historical<br/>\n&gt; spellings.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He points out that smallish minorities&#39; pronunciations<br/>\n&gt; can for the most part not be taken into account, but also<br/>\n&gt; that any truly Pan-Anglophone spelling reform. He is in<br/>\n&gt; favor of keeping post-vocalic r, which he hardly would<br/>\n&gt; have done if he had been a hardliner in what he calls the<br/>\n&gt; minimalist camp. I think he makes a good and fair<br/>\n&gt; assessment of the implications of accent differences for<br/>\n&gt; spelling reform - a subject which has been hotly<br/>\n&gt; discussed in this group recently.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wells also makes a good case for not distinguishing the<br/>\n&gt; lexical sets TRAP-FATHER-BATH (At-Ah in QS terminology) or<br/>\n&gt; LOT-THOUGHT-CLOTH (QS Ox-Awe). For all Read&#39;s genius when it<br/>\n&gt; came to Utter-and-Ado he seems to have been overly home-<br/>\n&gt; blind and maximist concerning these lexical sets. I find Awe<br/>\n&gt; and Ah cumbersome to write, and would not shed a tear if<br/>\n&gt; they were abolished, or used only to write foreign names.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wells also considers not to distinguish STRUT-FOOT-GOOSE (QS<br/>\n&gt; Utter-Foot-Ooze) although he himself is less sure about<br/>\n&gt; that. Read clearly knew what he was doing when deciding not<br/>\n&gt; to distinguish STRUT-About- commA or NURSE- lettER. For the<br/>\n&gt; majority who have split STRUT- FOOT it certainty relieves<br/>\n&gt; many uncertainties and thus anxieties.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One thing Wells doesn&#39;t address, but which is of utmost<br/>\n&gt; importance in balancing minimalism and maximalism, is the<br/>\n&gt; balancing of ease of encoding, or writing, against ease of<br/>\n&gt; decoding, or reading. When writing it causes little trouble<br/>\n&gt; if a number of distinctions one makes in speech are lumped<br/>\n&gt; together, but when reading it makes trouble both if too many<br/>\n&gt; distinctions one makes in speech are missing and if too many<br/>\n&gt; distinctions one doesn&#39;t make are present. That&#39;s exactly<br/>\n&gt; the problem with TO, which not only persists in making<br/>\n&gt; distinctions that were lost before Shakespeare, or already<br/>\n&gt; in Latin or Old French in the case of loanwords, but also in<br/>\n&gt; not making distinctions that have arisen since Shakespeare,<br/>\n&gt; though distinguishing some of the latter in an Pan-<br/>\n&gt; Anglophone spelling might be of doubtful value, as mentioned<br/>\n&gt; above, since their outcome varies across the English-<br/>\n&gt; speaking world.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for sight-site-cite Read didn&#39;t design QS to make<br/>\n&gt; distinctions nobody makes in speech, and rightly so. If we<br/>\n&gt; can use &#39;make a sighting&#39; or &#39;make a citation&#39; to make<br/>\n&gt; ourselves clear in ambiguous contexts when speaking we can<br/>\n&gt; do so in writing too. To be sure any respelling based on the<br/>\n&gt; Latin alphabet might look funny for a lot of reasons, pace<br/>\n&gt; Latin and Romance loanwords in Norwegian or Turkish. Thats<br/>\n&gt; one of the reasons I favor QS, the other being that it saves<br/>\n&gt; muscular effort while preserving linearity.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (You would find my foreign accent with undistinguished See-<br/>\n&gt; Zoo and She-J&#39;ai, and with a pronunciation of &quot;mayor&quot; which<br/>\n&gt; is halfway to &quot;measure&quot; as funny as the Filipinos&#39;. I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; never dream of putting it up as a model for English<br/>\n&gt; spelling, but neither do I expect to see foreign accents<br/>\n&gt; ridiculed by those who advocate spelling reform.
