phonemic or phonetic transcription system.<br/>\nOne will have to think in terms of Quikscript letter-<br/>\nshapes and letter- relations while using this mapping,<br/>\nbut that is meant to be an advantage rather than a<br/>\ndisadvantage!<br/>\n<br/>\n### List of assignments in BPJ 1<br/>\n<br/>\n(Assignments with a following * differ from Jerome<br/>\nkmap, and the half-letters with an * after their name<br/>\nare not found in the Quikscript Manual.)<br/>\n<br/>\n| QS #  | (Jerome) | Name         | BPJ 1   |<br/>\n|-------|----------|------------- |---------|<br/>\n| #1    | (p)      | Pea          |   p     |<br/>\n| #2    | (b)      | Bay          |   b     |<br/>\n| #3    | (t)      | Tea          |   t     |<br/>\n| #4    | (d)      | Day          |   d     |<br/>\n| #5    | (k)      | Key          |   k     |<br/>\n| #6    | (g)      | Gay          |   g     |<br/>\n| #7    | (T)      | Thaw         |   T     |<br/>\n| #8    | (H)      | They         |   D *   |<br/>\n| #9    | (f)      | Fee          |   f     |<br/>\n| #10   | (v)      | Vie          |   v     |<br/>\n| #11   | (s)      | See          |   s     |<br/>\n| #12   | (z)      | Zoo          |   z     |<br/>\n| #13   | (S)      | She          |   S     |<br/>\n| #14   | (Z)      | J&#39;ai         |   Z     |<br/>\n| #15   | (c)      | Cheer        |   c     |<br/>\n| #16   | (J)      | Jay          |   J     |<br/>\n| #17   | (j)      | Ye           |   j     |<br/>\n| #18   | (w)      | Way          |   w     |<br/>\n| #19   | (h)      | He           |   h     |<br/>\n| #20   | (`)      | Why          |   W *   |<br/>\n| #21   | (N)      | Ing          |   G *   |<br/>\n| #22   | (m)      | May          |   m     |<br/>\n| #23   | (n)      | No           |   n     |<br/>\n| #24   | (l)      | Low          |   l     |<br/>\n| #25   | (r)      | Roe          |   r     |<br/>\n<br/>\n| #26   | (i)      | It           |   i     |<br/>\n| #27   | (I)      | Eat          |   I     |<br/>\n| #28   | (e)      | Et           |   e     |<br/>\n| #29   | (E)      | Eight        |   E     |<br/>\n| #30   | (A)      | At           |   a *   |<br/>\n| #31   | (F)      | I            |   A *   |<br/>\n| #32   | (y)      | Ah           |   q *   |<br/>\n| #33   | (Y)      | Awe          |   Q *   |<br/>\n| #34   | (o)      | Ox           |   o     |<br/>\n| #35   | (q)      | Oy           |   O *   |<br/>\n| #36   | (a)      | Utter        |   y *   |<br/>\n| #37   | (Q)      | Out          |   Y *   |<br/>\n| #38   | (O)      | Owe          |   B *   |<br/>\n| #39   | (U)      | Foot         |   u *   |<br/>\n| #40   | (M)      | Ooze         |   U *   |<br/>\n| #41   | (\u008d)      | Loch         |   K *   |<br/>\n| #42   | (\u00be)      | Llan         |   L *   |<br/>\n| #43   | (\u008f)      | Excite       |   x *   |<br/>\n| #44   | (\u017d)      | Exam         |   X *   |<br/>\n<br/>\n| #23   | (G)      | Noon         |   N *   |<br/>\n| #36   | (u)      | Up           |   V *   |<br/>\n<br/>\n| -     | (/)      | naming dot   |   ` *   |<br/>\n| -     |          | left bracket |   (     |<br/>\n| -     |          | right bracket|   )     |<br/>\n<br/>\n| #1.5  | (])      | half-Pea     |   P *   |<br/>\n| #3.5  | ([)      | half-Tea     |   F *   |<br/>\n| #4.5  | (B)      | half-Day     |   R *   |<br/>\n| #12.5 | (L)      | half-Zoo     |   C *   |<br/>\n| #17.5 | (^)      | half-Ye *    |   ^     |<br/>\n| #18.5 | (@)      | half-Way     |   M *   |<br/>\n| #19.5 | (&#92;)      | half-He      |   H *   |<br/>\n| #20.5 | (~)      | half-Why *   |   ~     |<br/>\n<br/>\n### &#39;Paired&#39; vowel-letter assignments<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the fifteen Quikscript vowel-letters fourteen form<br/>\npairs of related shapes, and Read clearly endeavored to<br/>\nassign related sounds to the letters within each pair.<br/>\nThe six &#39;lax&#39; vowel phonemes of RP English have each<br/>\nbeen assigned a letter within one of there pairs -- the<br/>\none without an extra loop in in the four cases where<br/>\nthe difference between the paired letters consists of<br/>\nsuch a loop --, while the other letter of each pair has<br/>\nbeen assigned to a similar-sounding &#39;tense&#39; vowel or<br/>\ndiphthong. Five of the six RP &#39;lax&#39; vowel phonemes are<br/>\nreadily associated to five of the six TO vowel-<br/>\nletters, and thus the Quikscript letters for those<br/>\nphonemes have been mapped to the lower-case forms of<br/>\nthose associated letters: #26 = {i}, #28 = {e}, #30 =<br/>\n{a}, #34 = {o}, #39 = {u}, and the sixth RP &#39;lax&#39; vowel<br/>\nphoneme /V/, and its Quikscript letter #36 -- which<br/>\nalso is paired with a &#39;looped&#39; letter #37 -- has been<br/>\nmapped to the sixth TO vowel letter {y}.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext we assign the Quikscript letters which are paired<br/>\nwith the Quikscript letters assigned to the TO lower-<br/>\ncase vowel-letters to the corresponding TO upper-case<br/>\nvowel-letters. Some of these mappings make no<br/>\n&#39;phonetic&#39; sense; rather one has to remember the<br/>\nmapping of lower-case TO vowel-letters to Quikscript<br/>\nletters, and then the rule that the Quikscript letters<br/>\npaired with these letters are assigned to the<br/>\ncorresponding TO upper- case letters: 27 - I, 29 - E,<br/>\n<br/>\n### Some problematic assignments<br/>\n<br/>\nWe then come to the seventh Quikscript vowel letter<br/>\npair #32-#33. They are problematic, since there are no<br/>\nTO vowel letters readily available for them. I choose<br/>\nto assign them to the one TO upper-lower-case letter-<br/>\npair not readily associated with any English phoneme,<br/>\nnamely _Q-q_. This does not mean that there are no<br/>\nmemory-cues available for these mappings: Quikscript<br/>\nletter #33 can be seen as a shape variation of<br/>\nQuikscript letter #34, and the TO upper-case _Q_ is of<br/>\ncourse visually similar to a TO upper-case _O_, and,<br/>\nlikewise Quikscript letter ##32 can be seen as a shape<br/>\nvariation of Quikscript letter ##30, and TO lower- case<br/>\n_q_ is -- admittedly vaguely -- similar to a TO lower-<br/>\ncase script _a_.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast we come the unpaired Quikscript vowel-letter ##38.<br/>\nIt&#39;s sound is usually associated with the TO letter<br/>\n_o_, or one of the digraphs _oa, ou_ or _ow_ which all<br/>\ncontain _o_, but due to my choosen system for assigning<br/>\nthe &#39;paired&#39; Quikscript vowel- letters to TO letters<br/>\n_o_ and _O_ are already occupied by Quikscript letters<br/>\n#34-#35. Quikscript letter #38 must therefore be<br/>\nassigned to the otherwise unused TO letter upper-case<br/>\n_B_, which at least allows us to use the words &quot;bowl&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;bow&quot; (the noun), which recall the shape of the<br/>\nletter in the Quikscript Manual, as memory-cues. I<br/>\nreadily admit, however that this is the weakest point<br/>\nof my proposal: if one finds the system for assigning<br/>\nthe other vowels an advantage in favor of my proposal<br/>\none will simply have to take this weakness in the<br/>\nbargain! It was tempting to assign Quikscript letter<br/>\n#38 to the ASCII @ symbol, but I preferred to assign<br/>\nall the Quikscript letters which are sanctioned by the<br/>\nQuikscript Manual to Traditional Orthography upper- or<br/>\nlower- case letters leaving the ASCII symbol characters<br/>\nalone, and the namer dot to the &#39;back-tick&#39; {`} which<br/>\nis superfluous in normal typing, pace TeX.<br/>\n<br/>\n### Consonants<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are few innovations among the primary consonants,<br/>\nsince the majority of Quikscript consonant letters have<br/>\nan obvious one-to-one counterpart in Traditional<br/>\nOrthography. Most of the remaining have been assigned<br/>\nthem to the upper-case version of the letters for the<br/>\nmost similar sounds already assigned to a lower-case<br/>\nletter, and I think few will argue against the<br/>\nassignments #7 = {T}, #8 = {D}, #13 = {S}, #14 = {Z},<br/>\nnor with the assignment of #15 to lower-case {c}, where<br/>\nthe added complication of having to press the shift key<br/>\nseemed unwarranted. One might have preferred mapping<br/>\nQuikscript letter #13 to TO upper-case _C_ and<br/>\nQuikscript letter #14 to TO upper-case _J_, but the<br/>\nsystem of vowel-assignments has already preempted the<br/>\npair {y}-{Y} for use as vowels, so that TO lower-case<br/>\n_j_ had to be assigned to Quikscript letter #17, making<br/>\nit necessary to assign Quikscript letter #16 to TO<br/>\nupper-case _J_, in spite of this being a step away from<br/>\nnative speaker-writer&#39;s intuitions about TO letter-to-<br/>\nsound correspondances. At least it agrees with the old<br/>\nQuikscript font mapping.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reassignment -- in fact swapping -- of the<br/>\nassignments of _G_ and _N_ may be a cause for concern<br/>\nfor those used to &#39;traditional&#39; Quikscript fonts, but I<br/>\nthink it is warranted: the TO spelling _ng_ at least<br/>\ncontains a _g_, while words like _now, knack, knife,<br/>\nneed_ -- the the Quikscript Manual examples of initial<br/>\nalternate #23 -- don&#39;t, making transcriptions like<br/>\n{loGiG, NY, Nak, NAf, NId} more readibly recognizable<br/>\nthan *{loNiN, GY, Gak, GAf, GId}.  I&#39;m prepared to back<br/>\ndown on this point, however.<br/>\n<br/>\n## Benct Philip Jonsson&#39;s Quikscript key mapping<br/>\nproposal No. 2<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been considering a different arrangement which<br/>\nwould allow the assignment of Quikscript letter #17 to<br/>\n_y_ and other differences which would allow memory-cues<br/>\nwhich are perhaps more intuitive in terms of native<br/>\nspeakers&#39; and writers&#39;  expectations of TO sound-to-<br/>\nletter correspondences, though upper-case _B_ would<br/>\nstill be assigned to a vowel (and now memory-cued to<br/>\nthe word &quot;bough&quot;, which unfortunately is  pronounced<br/>\n/bQf/--/bAf/ as a family name!), and Quikscript letter<br/>\n#36 will be mapped to an ASCII non-letter (though an<br/>\nunshifted keyboard position on American and British<br/>\nkeyboards).<br/>\n<br/>\n### Assignments which differ between BPJ 1 and BPJ 2<br/>\n<br/>\n| QS #  | (Jerome) | Name         | BPJ 1   | BPJ 2   |<br/>\n|-------|----------|------------- |---------|---------|<br/>\n| #14   | (Z)      | J&#39;ai         |   Z     |   J *   |<br/>\n| #16   | (J)      | Jay          |   J     |   j *   |<br/>\n| #17   | (j)      | Ye           |   j     |   y *   |<br/>\n| #31   | (F)      | I            |   A *   |   Y *   |<br/>\n| #32   | (y)      | Ah           |   q *   |   A *   |<br/>\n| #34   | (o)      | Ox           |   o     |   o     |<br/>\n| #35   | (q)      | Oy           |   O *   |   q     |<br/>\n| #36   | (a)      | Utter        |   y *   |   ` *   |<br/>\n| #37   | (Q)      | Out          |   Y *   |   B *   |<br/>\n| #38   | (O)      | Owe          |   B *   |   O     |<br/>\n| -     | (/)      | naming dot   |   ` *   |   ^ *   |<br/>\n| #12.5 | (L)      | half-Zoo     |   C *   |   Z *   |<br/>\n| #17.5 | (^)      | half-Ye *    |   ^     |   C *   |<br/>\n<br/>\nThese changes do in fact amount to a different<br/>\nproposal, since it no longer includes the &#39;Quikscript-<br/>\ninternal&#39; &#39;paired&#39; vowel-letter assignments.

Five of the six RP &#39;lax&#39; vowel phonemes are\nreadily associated to five of the six TO vowel-\nletters, and thus the Quikscript letters for those\nphonemes have been mapped to the lower-case forms of\nthose associated letters: #26 = {i}, #28 = {e}, #30 =\n{a}, #34 = {o}, #39 = {u}, and the sixth RP &#39;lax&#39; vowel\nphoneme /V/, and its Quikscript letter #36 -- which\nalso is paired with a &#39;looped&#39; letter #37 -- has been\nmapped to the sixth TO vowel letter {y}.\n\nNext we assign the Quikscript letters which are paired\nwith the Quikscript letters assigned to the TO lower-\ncase vowel-letters to the corresponding TO upper-case\nvowel-letters. Some of these mappings make no\n&#39;phonetic&#39; sense; rather one has to remember the\nmapping of lower-case TO vowel-letters to Quikscript\nletters, and then the rule that the Quikscript letters\npaired with these letters are assigned to the\ncorresponding TO upper- case letters: 27 - I, 29 - E,\n\n### Some problematic assignments\n\nWe then come to the seventh Quikscript vowel letter\npair #32-#33. They are problematic, since there are no\nTO vowel letters readily available for them. I choose\nto assign them to the one TO upper-lower-case letter-\npair not readily associated with any English phoneme,\nnamely _Q-q_. This does not mean that there are no\nmemory-cues available for these mappings: Quikscript\nletter #33 can be seen as a shape variation of\nQuikscript letter #34, and the TO upper-case _Q_ is of\ncourse visually similar to a TO upper-case _O_, and,\nlikewise Quikscript letter ##32 can be seen as a shape\nvariation of Quikscript letter ##30, and TO lower- case\n_q_ is -- admittedly vaguely -- similar to a TO lower-\ncase script _a_.\n\nLast we come the unpaired Quikscript vowel-letter ##38.\nIt&#39;s sound is usually associated with the TO letter\n_o_, or one of the digraphs _oa, ou_ or _ow_ which all\ncontain _o_, but due to my choosen system for assigning\nthe &#39;paired&#39; Quikscript vowel- letters to TO letters\n_o_ and _O_ are already occupied by Quikscript letters\n#34-#35. Quikscript letter #38 must therefore be\nassigned to the otherwise unused TO letter upper-case\n_B_, which at least allows us to use the words &quot;bowl&quot;\nand &quot;bow&quot; (the noun), which recall the shape of the\nletter in the Quikscript Manual, as memory-cues. I\nreadily admit, however that this is the weakest point\nof my proposal: if one finds the system for assigning\nthe other vowels an advantage in favor of my proposal\none will simply have to take this weakness in the\nbargain! It was tempting to assign Quikscript letter\n#38 to the ASCII @ symbol, but I preferred to assign\nall the Quikscript letters which are sanctioned by the\nQuikscript Manual to Traditional Orthography upper- or\nlower- case letters leaving the ASCII symbol characters\nalone, and the namer dot to the &#39;back-tick&#39; {`} which\nis superfluous in normal typing, pace TeX.\n\n### Consonants\n\nThere are few innovations among the primary consonants,\nsince the majority of Quikscript consonant letters have\nan obvious one-to-one counterpart in Traditional\nOrthography. Most of the remaining have been assigned\nthem to the upper-case version of the letters for the\nmost similar sounds already assigned to a lower-case\nletter, and I think few will argue against the\nassignments #7 = {T}, #8 = {D}, #13 = {S}, #14 = {Z},\nnor with the assignment of #15 to lower-case {c}, where\nthe added complication of having to press the shift key\nseemed unwarranted. One might have preferred mapping\nQuikscript letter #13 to TO upper-case _C_ and\nQuikscript letter #14 to TO upper-case _J_, but the\nsystem of vowel-assignments has already preempted the\npair {y}-{Y} for use as vowels, so that TO lower-case\n_j_ had to be assigned to Quikscript letter #17, making\nit necessary to assign Quikscript letter #16 to TO\nupper-case _J_, in spite of this being a step away from\nnative speaker-writer&#39;s intuitions about TO letter-to-\nsound correspondances. At least it agrees with the old\nQuikscript font mapping.\n\nThe reassignment -- in fact swapping -- of the\nassignments of _G_ and _N_ may be a cause for concern\nfor those used to &#39;traditional&#39; Quikscript fonts, but I\nthink it is warranted: the TO spelling _ng_ at least\ncontains a _g_, while words like _now, knack, knife,\nneed_ -- the the Quikscript Manual examples of initial\nalternate #23 -- don&#39;t, making transcriptions like\n{loGiG, NY, Nak, NAf, NId} more readibly recognizable\nthan *{loNiN, GY, Gak, GAf, GId}.  I&#39;m prepared to back\ndown on this point, however.\n\n## Benct Philip Jonsson&#39;s Quikscript key mapping\nproposal No. 2\n\nI have been considering a different arrangement which\nwould allow the assignment of Quikscript letter #17 to\n_y_ and other differences which would allow memory-cues\nwhich are perhaps more intuitive in terms of native\nspeakers&#39; and writers&#39;  expectations of TO sound-to-\nletter correspondences, though upper-case _B_ would\nstill be assigned to a vowel (and now memory-cued to\nthe word &quot;bough&quot;, which unfortunately is  pronounced\n/bQf/--/bAf/ as a family name!), and Quikscript letter\n#36 will be mapped to an ASCII non-letter (though an\nunshifted keyboard position on American and British\nkeyboards).\n\n### Assignments which differ between BPJ 1 and BPJ 2\n\n| QS #  | (Jerome) | Name         | BPJ 1   | BPJ 2   |\n|-------|----------|------------- |---------|---------|\n| #14   | (Z)      | J&#39;ai         |   Z     |   J *   |\n| #16   | (J)      | Jay          |   J     |   j *   |\n| #17   | (j)      | Ye           |   j     |   y *   |\n| #31   | (F)      | I            |   A *   |   Y *   |\n| #32   | (y)      | Ah           |   q *   |   A *   |\n| #34   | (o)      | Ox           |   o     |   o     |\n| #35   | (q)      | Oy           |   O *   |   q     |\n| #36   | (a)      | Utter        |   y *   |   ` *   |\n| #37   | (Q)      | Out          |   Y *   |   B *   |\n| #38   | (O)      | Owe          |   B *   |   O     |\n| -     | (/)      | naming dot   |   ` *   |   ^ *   |\n| #12.5 | (L)      | half-Zoo     |   C *   |   Z *   |\n| #17.5 | (^)      | half-Ye *    |   ^     |   C *   |\n\nThese changes do in fact amount to a different\nproposal, since it no longer includes the &#39;Quikscript-\ninternal&#39; &#39;paired&#39; vowel-letter assignments.
