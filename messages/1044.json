I myself am reading Edmund Spenser&#39;s Faerie<br>\n&gt;     &gt; Queene (1590) right now, and even though there are no J&#39;s, and<br>\n&gt;     V&#39;s and<br>\n&gt;     &gt; U&#39;s change depending on whether the letter appears at the<br>\n&gt;     beginning of<br>\n&gt;     &gt; a word, I am not having any trouble reading it, even with the<br>\n&gt;     &gt; irregularity of spelling.<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; What I think more than anything will prove what we&#39;re talking about<br>\n&gt;     &gt; (not proving that someone&#39;s right or wrong, but testing the<br>\n&gt;     situation<br>\n&gt;     &gt; itself) is actual usage.

We can<br>\n&gt;     &gt; talk all day long about how things could be, but the only thing that<br>\n&gt;     &gt; matters is how things are or will be in actuality.<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; -Benjamin Bruce<br>\n&gt;     &gt; BenjaminBruce.com<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; 2007/9/10, pgabhart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pgabhart%40sbcglobal.net\">pgabhart@...</a><br></span></div>\n&gt;     &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pgabhart%25\">pgabhart%</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40sbcglobal.net\">40sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pgabhart%40sbcglobal.net\">pgabhart@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pgabhart%25\">\npgabhart%</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40sbcglobal.net\">40sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;&gt;&gt;:<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-144827362e\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-144827362q_115094de7c466773_4\"><br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; First, I disagree with the statement &quot;QS is meant to be heard.&quot; Not<br>\n&gt;     &gt; meaning to be categorical, but QS is an attempt to realign English<br>\n&gt;     &gt; with<br>\n&gt;     &gt; an alphabet that works the way an alphabet is supposed to: one<br>\n&gt;     &gt; sound =<br>\n&gt;     &gt; one phoneme. The QS manual starts off with the reasons why trying to<br>\n&gt;     &gt; redesign the Roman alphabet just doesn&#39;t cut it. A new alphabet<br>\n&gt;     &gt; was needed.<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; The problem I see with standardized spelling is that the<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &quot;English-speaking Peoples&quot; have no language academy to even<br>\n&gt;     &gt; attempt to<br>\n&gt;     &gt; enforce spelling changes as the language continues to evolve. That is<br>\n&gt;     &gt; sort of how we got in this mess (TO) to begin with.<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; I may be abysmally ignorant of the extent of English dialects, but I<br>\n&gt;     &gt; suspect that for a very large majority of English speakers, i.e. the<br>\n&gt;     &gt; ones clustered in the middle of the bell curve of English<br>\n&gt;     &gt; pronunciation,<br>\n&gt;     &gt; we could get along just fine without a standardized spelling<br>\n&gt;     &gt; because the<br>\n&gt;     &gt; majority of the words we use on a daily basis are not going to be<br>\n&gt;     &gt; spelt<br>\n&gt;     &gt; so peculiarly by someone from a different, but still one of the major<br>\n&gt;     &gt; speech communities that it would not be recognizable. To be sure,<br>\n&gt;     &gt; there<br>\n&gt;     &gt; are the outliers on that bell curve who would need to conform their<br>\n&gt;     &gt; speech to a dialect in broader use than their own such as they would<br>\n&gt;     &gt; hear on the BBC or from American news outlets. But for most of us, I<br>\n&gt;     &gt; doubt we would need spelling police. For example, if I write<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &quot;schedule&quot;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; with a &quot;k&quot; sound, and a Londoner reads it, I seriously doubt, he<br>\n&gt;     &gt; would<br>\n&gt;     &gt; have more than a moment&#39;s hesitation in deciphering the word even<br>\n&gt;     &gt; though<br>\n&gt;     &gt; he doesn&#39;t pronounce it that way.<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; If we start insisting that every word must be spelt in accordance<br>\n&gt;     &gt; with<br>\n&gt;     &gt; an arbitrary standard that does not match anyone&#39;s speech completely,<br>\n&gt;     &gt; then we will be back to looking up many words and memorizing their<br>\n&gt;     &gt; spelling. It is my understanding that in Shakespeare&#39;s time, the idea<br>\n&gt;     &gt; of proper spelling did not exist, and the Bard was quite content to<br>\n&gt;     &gt; spell a word one way today and differently tomorrow. That apparently<br>\n&gt;     &gt; didn&#39;t hold him back We all have been prejudiced by our schooling and<br>\n&gt;     &gt; what Kingsley Read called the &quot;cultural fetish&quot; of spelling to reject<br>\n&gt;     &gt; the idea that we can spell words the way we want. If we go too far<br>\n&gt;     &gt; astray, our readers won&#39;t understand, and we pay the price of not<br>\n&gt;     &gt; being<br>\n&gt;     &gt; read. That by itself, forces a high level of conformism onto the<br>\n&gt;     &gt; situation, but to insist that we all have to spell in lockstep or be<br>\n&gt;     &gt; considered morons is quite a different matter.<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; I have seen a number of people insist that we have to have<br>\n&gt;     &gt; standardized<br>\n&gt;     &gt; spelling or we are doomed, but I doubt anyone has actually studied<br>\n&gt;     &gt; this<br>\n&gt;     &gt; so we have no real data as to how an alternative English alphabet<br>\n&gt;     &gt; would<br>\n&gt;     &gt; work if it did or did not use standardized spelling. For example, let<br>\n&gt;     &gt; us assume that we don&#39;t insist on standardized spelling and that<br>\n&gt;     &gt; it was<br>\n&gt;     &gt; later found that that decision slowed the average reading speed by<br>\n&gt;     &gt; 5 or<br>\n&gt;     &gt; 10 % (I doubt it would be any greater than that). Would that not be a<br>\n&gt;     &gt; reasonable price to pay to avoid putting ourselves back in the<br>\n&gt;     &gt; position<br>\n&gt;     &gt; of attempting to memorize how words should be spelt rather than<br>\n&gt;     &gt; spelling<br>\n&gt;     &gt; them the way they sound in speech? I believe it would, especially for<br>\n&gt;     &gt; the dyslexics among us, who cannot deal with arbitrary spellings.<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; If a person occasionally is unsure how to spell a word because he<br>\n&gt;     &gt; suspects he may pronounce it differently than others, he could always<br>\n&gt;     &gt; look it up in a dictionary. This is better than trying to memorize<br>\n&gt;     &gt; the<br>\n&gt;     &gt; spelling of virtually his entire vocabulary in order to have it<br>\n&gt;     &gt; comply<br>\n&gt;     &gt; with an arbitrary standard of speech.<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; Paige<br>\n&gt;     &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; John Cowan wrote:<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; amd64_hacker scripsit:<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I&#39;m for abbreviations in all texts.<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that since QS is meant to be &#39;heard&#39; it<br>\n&gt;     &gt; shouldn&#39;t matter<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; how the word is written but how it is read.<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; Well, yes, but that slows down reading to the speed of speech. I<br>\n&gt;     &gt; suspect<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; that rapid silent reading and standardized orthography go<br>\n&gt;     together --<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; we do know that fluent readers recognize familiar words by the<br>\n&gt;     total<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; shape of the word, slowing down only when they must to read an<br>\n&gt;     &gt; unfamilar<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; word, and that this is equally true in languages that are<br>\n&gt;     rationally<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; spelled, irrationally spelled, or not spelled at all (like<br>\n&gt;     Chinese).<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; So if QS is going to become important for works meant to be read<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; more than once (as opposed to shorthand/transcription uses), a<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; standardized orthography will have to evolve.<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; Which immediately leads to the issue of dialects. One&#39;s obvious and<br>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; natural phonetic orthography is another&#39;s stumbling block.
