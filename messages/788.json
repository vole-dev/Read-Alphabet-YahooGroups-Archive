  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-848834834\">I agree with PhD: Latin is not going anywhere, and in fact it is a<br/>\ngreat alphabet for many languages (especially Italian and Spanish,<br/>\nFrench not so much so).  It is not too jarring to mix standard<br/>\northography and Quickscript, so when referring to something in &#39;the<br/>\nkey of F flat&#39; the F could remain written in Latin.  Acronyms are the<br/>\nsame, though if we are not careful we will get ourselves into exactly<br/>\nthe same situation as the Japanese where up to four writing systems<br/>\nare intermixed constantly (Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana, Romaji/Latin). <br/>\nI would hate to see what a Japanese/Arabic dictionary looks like ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternately, new acronyms could be made up: but how to distinguish<br/>\nthem as acronyms?  &quot;Fie-Bay-It&quot; is just as easy to say as &quot;FBI&quot; but<br/>\nthe idea of putting a name dot in front of each character is<br/>\nunappealing: &quot;dot fie dot bay dot it&quot; is certainly no easier to write<br/>\nthan the Latin version.  And as PhD points out, often the acronyms are<br/>\nmore well known than the names themselves, anyway.  Personally, I vote<br/>\nfor the mix: QS + Latin characters.<br/>\n<br/>\namd64_hacker, I am not familiar with xkb, sorry; but I have been<br/>\nsuccessful in making keyboard maps on Mac OS X.  That is how I have<br/>\nbeen entering unicode in my tests, recently, and I have to admit that<br/>\nmy own keyboard map (in the files section) is good but not great: it<br/>\nrequires too much use of the shift key.  Also, when it is active, none<br/>\nof the hot-keys work as I expect them to (command-x, etc.), since<br/>\nthose letters have been remapped.  I think a good way to go might be<br/>\nlike my wife&#39;s Chinese-input keyboard: when the caps-lock key is down,<br/>\nit types Latin characters; when up, it types strokes which get<br/>\nassembled into full characters.  In our case, a keyboard mapping which<br/>\nis standard Latin + numbers normally, but Quickscript when Caps Lock<br/>\nis down, would be ideal: it could be left on virtually all the time (I<br/>\nnever use the Caps Lock myself, in fact having remapped it to act like<br/>\na second control key).<br/>\n<br/>\nI looked at your perl script, but I can&#39;t make out the actual mapping:<br/>\ndoes the hex code in @keys refer to its current or new mapping?
