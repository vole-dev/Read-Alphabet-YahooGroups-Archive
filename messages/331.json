  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1268131410\">I\ufffdve used Quickscript for quite a while now. I both<br/>\nread and write it without any aid of charts or<br/>\ncheat-sheets. I Love languages and speak several. With<br/>\nthat behind us, discussions about alphabets can be<br/>\nhelpful here.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you talk about \ufffdvoiced\ufffd, un-voiced\ufffd, \ufffdIPA<br/>\ndistinctions\ufffd but most children would give you a blank<br/>\nlook if you starting into a discussion on them. I<br/>\nbelieve that and effective language should be simple<br/>\nenough that a child can learn it. One way to help<br/>\nsomeone to learn a language is to have the most used<br/>\ncharacters as simple as possible. So once you learn<br/>\nmost used characters, you\ufffdd be able to write a lot of<br/>\nstuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nLanguage is as much about reading as its\ufffd about<br/>\nwriting, so an alphabet should address the reader as<br/>\nmuch as the writer. When we read effectively, we read<br/>\nwhole word forms, not letter by letter. So languages<br/>\nthat contain all parallel forms can be hard to read<br/>\nfast. You\ufffdre forced to interpret each letter. I think<br/>\nthe use of descending and raised characters should be<br/>\nused sparingly and only as part of forming whole word<br/>\ndistinction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that related sounds should have a like or<br/>\ninverse lettering scheme aid in memorization.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said, \ufffdIn the case of quickscript, for instance, I<br/>\nbelieve it is imbalanced slightly on the side writing<br/>\nspeed against mnemonics and readability.\ufffd LOL No<br/>\nflack, we all have our views. I think that unless a<br/>\nperson is using an alphabet a LOT, even if they can<br/>\nwrite it, they still might not be able to write it in<br/>\na speedy manner. It takes a lot of reading to get used<br/>\nto the word shapes/ionized forms. I journal most every<br/>\nday and all my daily personal writings are in<br/>\nQuickscript. Every time I go to journal, I go back and<br/>\nread several days worth of old writings. It\ufffds taken a<br/>\nlong time but I read Quickscript just about as fast as<br/>\nstandard English character writing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for you comments!<br/>\nChuck<br/>\n<br/>\n--- kyudosha &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kyudosha@...\">kyudosha@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know this may be getting annoying, but I&#39;m a bit<br/>\n&gt; of an alphabet-<br/>\n&gt; phile, so I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll all bear with me.

This <br/>\n&gt; way, they are actually sharply differentiated<br/>\n&gt; against the rest of the <br/>\n&gt; letters by their height.  Perhaps they could all be<br/>\n&gt; moved to the <br/>\n&gt; upper parallel to make them sort of floaty (as<br/>\n&gt; vowels tend to be), <br/>\n&gt; but I&#39;ll leave that to you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, the voiced characters as descenders are going<br/>\n&gt; to make for some <br/>\n&gt; very messy writing  & I will explain why:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In english, you will note that we have very few<br/>\n&gt; descending letters:<br/>\n&gt; lowercase g,j,p,q,and y only.  These are because<br/>\n&gt; descenders tend to <br/>\n&gt; clutter, clump and generally make unreadable<br/>\n&gt; whatever is directly <br/>\n&gt; below them.  You will also note that, in response to<br/>\n&gt; this, the <br/>\n&gt; descenders we DO have are comparatively simple and<br/>\n&gt; uncluttered; they <br/>\n&gt; are straight and thin or slightly curved and thin.<br/>\n&gt; In your scheme, <br/>\n&gt; you will have large portions of characters resting<br/>\n&gt; below the writing <br/>\n&gt; line, and this will virtually necessitate a<br/>\n&gt; double-spaced and <br/>\n&gt; inefficient format.   Other languages have solved<br/>\n&gt; (or never <br/>\n&gt; encountered) the problem of descenders by simply<br/>\n&gt; making one square <br/>\n&gt; writing line (Chinese, Japanese, Korean for<br/>\n&gt; instance).  I would <br/>\n&gt; suggest the same to you.  Once again, I would argue<br/>\n&gt; that most people <br/>\n&gt; do not really make the IPA distinctions (in this<br/>\n&gt; case between voiced <br/>\n&gt; and unvoiced).  HowEVER, people ARE able to think of<br/>\n&gt; a relation <br/>\n&gt; between sounds, so your scheme of inversing letters<br/>\n&gt; to denote <br/>\n&gt; voiced/unvoiced pairs is still a good one and will<br/>\n&gt; help in <br/>\n&gt; memorization.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you still wish to retain some immediately<br/>\n&gt; definining character <br/>\n&gt; between voiced and unvoiced, perhaps a little<br/>\n&gt; tweaking is in order?  <br/>\n&gt; Maybe make all unvoiced characters start in the<br/>\n&gt; lower right quadrant <br/>\n&gt; and all voiced ones in the upper right?  Those<br/>\n&gt; exceptions to pairs <br/>\n&gt; could start anywhere else.  These are of course just<br/>\n&gt; random ideas to <br/>\n&gt; let you know directions you could take.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I personally think it would be fine without such<br/>\n&gt; distinctions aside <br/>\n&gt; from the inverting.  When creating a new alphabet,<br/>\n&gt; it is often easy <br/>\n&gt; to err on the side of either mnemonics, readability<br/>\n&gt; or writing speed, <br/>\n&gt; whilst throwing one or both of the others out of<br/>\n&gt; balance.  In the <br/>\n&gt; case of quickscript, for instance, I believe it is<br/>\n&gt; imbalanced <br/>\n&gt; slightly on the side writing speed against mnemonics<br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; readability.  Now, I know I&#39;ll probably catch some<br/>\n&gt; flak for saying <br/>\n&gt; that here, but it&#39;s true.  This is not to say that<br/>\n&gt; Quickscript needs <br/>\n&gt; to be changed.  Far from it.  In fact, I still love<br/>\n&gt; it.  I&#39;m just <br/>\n&gt; pointing out some things for perspective.  English<br/>\n&gt; as-is is <br/>\n&gt; unbalanced against mnemonics, and clearscript (even<br/>\n&gt; without <br/>\n&gt; descenders) has one-up in this instance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In making a usable alphabet, it&#39;s all about what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; important to you <br/>\n&gt; and about considering who you&#39;re creating for.
