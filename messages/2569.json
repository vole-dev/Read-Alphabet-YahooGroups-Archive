A decade later, after Ewell had become a supporter of the Unicode Standard, he worked to improve his alphabet\u2019s character repertoire and encoding. Ewellic is a phonemic alphabet, like Shavian, Unifon, and shorthands such as Pitman and Gregg. With fonts specially designed by Michael Everson, this edition of Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland is written entirely in this unique featural alphabet.<br/>\n==========<br/>\nMichaael Everson<br/>\nEvertype, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://alice-in-wonderland-books.com\">http://alice-in-wonderland-books.com</a></div>",
