&nbsp;Shaw wanted a phonetic alphabet and more abbreviated so he could fit more letters on a page. &nbsp;However, my sense was that the more abbreviated strokes often make one hesitate unless one is either\n accustomed to it or can take slight alterations of the letter in stride.</div><div><br></div><div>For example, the &quot;uh&quot; in kom in the QS could suffer from readability if written quickly in a cursive link. &nbsp;The pause for readability would prevent fluid readability that would not be the case with an alphabet shorthand since we are more accustomed to the latin letters which are a bit more elaborated.</div><div><br></div><div>Frankly, I began to think of the alphabets as more of a secret code such as I use to get from old-time radio programs as Capt. Midnight, Jack Armstrong, etc. &nbsp;I use it to write down what I would not want anyone else to read or know about which is really not often.</div><div><br></div><div>My own experience in correspondence was that it was brief. &nbsp;I wrote to a man in New Zealand for awhile but unless one has a particular common interest in some matter the correspondence begins to wear thin after awhile.\n &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The last point about not being a purist about Read&#39;s alphabets is that others -- I believe it was Mr. Page, was it not? who developed a revised version of Read&#39;s alphabet which I was tempted to send for. &nbsp;And, I have noticed even in Esperanto that &quot;x&quot; I believe became a &quot;ch&quot; character that Zamenhoff did not create at the time it became popular. &nbsp;My point here is that human nature likes to tinker with such matters -- languages change, alphabets get altered, etc. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It might be if there is enough interest that some people will get together and in some way try to integrate both Shaw&#39;s alphabet and QS or accept a further revision of Read&#39;s work. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think it would be a heresy to take an interest in the advantages, if any, in adopting a more practical or aesthetic approach. &nbsp; The point here of my own interest is whether his language creations have benefits that have not\n been thoroughly covered</div><div><br></div><div>Sid<br><br>--- On <b>Fri, 8/19/11, Sid Tanaban <i>&lt;sidban2@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<br><blockquote style=\"border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);\"><br>From: Sid Tanaban &lt;sidban2@...&gt;<br>Subject: Re: [Read_Alphabet] Re: I&#39;d like to be able to write the prefixes com- and con- as contractions<br>To: Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com<br>Date: Friday, August 19, 2011, 8:04 PM<br><br><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1959732166yiv860747502\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<span>&nbsp;</span>\n\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1959732166yiv860747502ygrp-text\">\n      \n      \n      <p><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td valign=\"top\" style=\"font:inherit;\">Mr. Read was quite willing to abandon the Shaw&#39;s alphabet and use other letters that he thought more suitable. &nbsp;It was his opinion -- not a scientific rule! &nbsp;My opinion would be if you do not like &quot;o&quot; then use the &quot;uh&quot; of Shaw&#39;s alphabet. &nbsp;Actually, I recognize that very easily. &nbsp;I studied Shaw&#39;s alphabet before QS and think some of the letters are much more aesthetically drawn. &nbsp;And, that would be my viewpoint about other questions about such a matter. &nbsp;Mr. Read may or may not have been dogmatic about what he created but it is really preferable for your own use to choose what is delightful and easy to read. &nbsp;After all, do you want to view this as one would view the Bible? &nbsp;The script is only a tool for one&#39;s own pleasure and surely a minor change is not going to harm readability, particularly when everyone\n is sounding\n out these words according to their own particular use of English anyway.<div><br></div><div>I am sure someone will object to what I have to say and I would be curious if someone feels that there is something I have overlooked. &nbsp;If so, please convey your thought on it.</div><div>Sid<br><br>--- On <b>Fri, 8/19/11, cossyrosario <i>&lt;cossyrosario@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:<br><blockquote style=\"border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);\"><br>From: cossyrosario &lt;cossyrosario@...&gt;<br>Subject: [Read_Alphabet] Re: I&#39;d like to be able to write the prefixes com- and con- as contractions<br>To: Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com<br>Date: Friday, August 19, 2011, 12:28 PM<br><br><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1959732166yiv860747502\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<span>&nbsp;</span>\n\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1959732166yiv860747502ygrp-text\">\n      \n      \n      <p>What is T.O.?<br>\nTraditional Orthodox?

problem in kom=\r\n. =C2=A0I realize that I did and still have a preference for certain letter=\r\ns and find them more readable. =C2=A0For example, I really like the &quot;h&quot; in =\r\nthe Shaw&#39;s alphabet compared to the &quot;h&quot; in QS which some careless writers m=\r\nay not give full attention to the hook. =C2=A0In any case, it does not have=\r\n the fluidity of the Shaw&#39;s &quot;h.&quot; =C2=A0That is, of course, an opinion but I=\r\n did have to really &quot;fight&quot; in my mind about the utility of using it. =C2=\r\n=A0I realize it was probably changed because it could be confused with a &quot;b=\r\n&quot; in QS or an &quot;m.&quot; =C2=A0And, I think that one has to think about that when=\r\n creating a script that is highly readable even when the writer is not exac=\r\ntly concerned about readability.\nShorthand however, demands this precisenes=\r\ns whereas one can get away with a bit of thready lettering mostly due to ou=\r\nr familiarity with the context and word from repeated reading and writing c=\r\nompared to Read&#39;s alphabet. =C2=A0The English language would have to be com=\r\npulsively standardized to get a closer familiarity on scribbled words I sho=\r\nuld think.\nI watch Aljazeera on t.v. and there are people in the Phillippin=\r\nes, India, and other areas in which international English pronunciation is =\r\nnot well-known at all. =C2=A0And, i have given up on some Australians whose=\r\n dialect is way over my head -- unfortunately --- as I was eager to be comp=\r\nanionable with them. =C2=A0The answer of course, would be to teach children=\r\n two pronunciations of the English language -- their own and the internatio=\r\nnal pronunciation. =C2=A0I have heard some beautiful sounding English words=\r\n that are clear as a bell but it has not become an essential diplomat&#39;s foc=\r\nus when I watch international programs. =C2=A0Is there someone out there wh=\r\no could.......\nMany thanks for the patience of those who read this.\nSid\n\n--=\r\n- On Fri, 8/19/11, Sid Tanaban &lt;sidban2@...&gt;

in kom in the QS could suffer from readability if =\r\nwritten quickly in a cursive link. =C2=A0The pause for readability would pr=\r\nevent fluid readability that would not be the case with an alphabet shortha=\r\nnd since we are more accustomed to the latin letters which are a bit more e=\r\nlaborated.\nFrankly, I began to think of the alphabets as more of a secret c=\r\node such as I use to get from old-time radio programs as Capt. Midnight, Ja=\r\nck Armstrong, etc. =C2=A0I use it to write down what I would not want anyon=\r\ne else to read or know about which is really not often.\nMy own experience i=\r\nn correspondence was that it was brief. =C2=A0I wrote to a man in New Zeala=\r\nnd for awhile but unless one has a particular common interest in some matte=\r\nr the correspondence begins to wear thin after awhile.\n =C2=A0\nThe last poi=\r\nnt about not being a purist about Read&#39;s alphabets is that others -- I beli=\r\neve it was Mr. Page, was it not? who developed a revised version of Read&#39;s =\r\nalphabet which I was tempted to send for. =C2=A0And, I have noticed even in=\r\n Esperanto that &quot;x&quot; I believe became a &quot;ch&quot; character that Zamenhoff did no=\r\nt create at the time it became popular. =C2=A0My point here is that human n=\r\nature likes to tinker with such matters -- languages change, alphabets get =\r\naltered, etc. =C2=A0\nIt might be if there is enough interest that some peop=\r\nle will get together and in some way try to integrate both Shaw&#39;s alphabet =\r\nand QS or accept a further revision of Read&#39;s work. =C2=A0I don&#39;t think it =\r\nwould be a heresy to take an interest in the advantages, if any, in adoptin=\r\ng a more practical or aesthetic approach. =C2=A0 The point here of my own i=\r\nnterest is whether his language creations have benefits that have not\n been=\r\n thoroughly covered\nSid\n\n--- On Fri, 8/19/11, Sid Tanaban &lt;sidban2@...=\r\nm&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Sid Tanaban &lt;sidban2@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [Read_Alphabe=\r\nt] Re: I&#39;d like to be able to write the prefixes com- and con- as contracti=\r\nons\nTo: Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Friday, August 19, 2011, 8:04 P=\r\nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      Mr. Read was quite wi=\r\nlling to abandon the Shaw&#39;s alphabet and use other letters that he thought =\r\nmore suitable. =C2=A0It was his opinion -- not a scientific rule! =C2=A0My =\r\nopinion would be if you do not like &quot;o&quot; then use the &quot;uh&quot; of Shaw&#39;s alphabe=\r\nt. =C2=A0Actually, I recognize that very easily. =C2=A0I studied Shaw&#39;s alp=\r\nhabet before QS and think some of the letters are much more aesthetically d=\r\nrawn. =C2=A0And, that would be my viewpoint about other questions about suc=\r\nh a matter. =C2=A0Mr. Read may or may not have been dogmatic about what he =\r\ncreated but it is really preferable for your own use to choose what is deli=\r\nghtful and easy to read. =C2=A0After all, do you want to view this as one w=\r\nould view the Bible? =C2=A0The script is only a tool for one&#39;s own pleasure=\r\n and surely a minor change is not going to harm readability, particularly w=\r\nhen everyone\n is sounding\n out these words according to their own particula=\r\nr use of English anyway.\nI am sure someone will object to what I have to sa=\r\ny and I would be curious if someone feels that there is something I have ov=\r\nerlooked. =C2=A0If so, please convey your thought on it.Sid\n\n--- On Fri, 8/=\r\n19/11, cossyrosario &lt;cossyrosario@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: cossyrosario &lt;=\r\ncossyrosario@...&gt;\nSubject: [Read_Alphabet] Re: I&#39;d like to be able =\r\nto write the prefixes com- and con- as contractions\nTo: Read_Alphabet@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com\nDate: Friday, August 19, 2011, 12:28 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n=C2=A0\n=\r\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      What is T.O.?\n\nTraditional Orthodox?

in the Shaw&#39;s alphabet compared to the &quot;h&quot; in QS=\r\n which some careless writers may not give full attention to the hook. &nbsp=\r\n;In any case, it does not have the fluidity of the Shaw&#39;s &quot;h.&quot; &nbsp;That i=\r\ns, of course, an opinion but I did have to really &quot;fight&quot; in my mind about =\r\nthe utility of using it. &nbsp;I realize it was probably changed because it=\r\n could be confused with a &quot;b&quot; in QS or an &quot;m.&quot; &nbsp;And, I think that one =\r\nhas to think about that when creating a script that is highly readable even=\r\n when the writer is not exactly concerned about readability.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;Shorthand however, demands this preciseness whereas one can get away w=\r\nith\n a bit of thready lettering mostly due to our familiarity with the cont=\r\next and word from repeated reading and writing compared to Read&#39;s alphabet.=\r\n &nbsp;The English language would have to be compulsively standardized to g=\r\net a closer familiarity on scribbled words I should think.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;I watch Aljazeera on t.v. and there are people in the Phillippines=\r\n, India, and other areas in which international English pronunciation is no=\r\nt well-known at all. &nbsp;And, i have given up on some Australians whose d=\r\nialect is way over my head -- unfortunately --- as I was eager to be compan=\r\nionable with them. &nbsp;The answer of course, would be to teach children t=\r\nwo pronunciations of the English language -- their own and the internationa=\r\nl pronunciation. &nbsp;I have heard some beautiful sounding English words t=\r\nhat are clear as a bell but it has not become an essential diplomat&#39;s focus=\r\n when I watch international programs. &nbsp;Is there someone out there\n who=\r\n could.......&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Many thanks for the patience of thos=\r\ne who read this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sid&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-=\r\n-- On &lt;b&gt;Fri, 8/19/11, Sid Tanaban &lt;i&gt;&lt;sidban2@...&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

in kom in the QS c=\r\nould suffer from readability if written quickly in a cursive link. &nbsp;Th=\r\ne pause for readability would prevent fluid readability that would not be t=\r\nhe case with an alphabet shorthand since we are more accustomed to the lati=\r\nn letters which are a bit more elaborated.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Frankly=\r\n, I began to think of the alphabets as more of a secret code such as I use =\r\nto get from old-time radio programs as Capt. Midnight, Jack Armstrong, etc.=\r\n &nbsp;I use it to write down what I would not want anyone else to read or =\r\nknow about which is really not often.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My own exper=\r\nience in correspondence was that it was brief. &nbsp;I wrote to a man in Ne=\r\nw Zealand for awhile but unless one has a particular common interest in som=\r\ne matter the correspondence begins to wear thin after awhile.\n &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The last point about not being a purist about Read&#39;s al=\r\nphabets is that others -- I believe it was Mr. Page, was it not? who develo=\r\nped a revised version of Read&#39;s alphabet which I was tempted to send for. &=\r\nnbsp;And, I have noticed even in Esperanto that &quot;x&quot; I believe became a &quot;ch&quot;=\r\n character that Zamenhoff did not create at the time it became popular. &nb=\r\nsp;My point here is that human nature likes to tinker with such matters -- =\r\nlanguages change, alphabets get altered, etc. &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;It might be if there is enough interest that some people will get togeth=\r\ner and in some way try to integrate both Shaw&#39;s alphabet and QS or accept a=\r\n further revision of Read&#39;s work. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think it would be a heresy =\r\nto take an interest in the advantages, if any, in adopting a more practical=\r\n or aesthetic approach. &nbsp; The point here of my own interest is whether=\r\n his language creations have benefits that have not\n been thoroughly covere=\r\nd&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sid&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Fri, 8/19/11, Sid Tanaban &lt;=\r\ni&gt;&lt;sidban2@...&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-l=\r\neft:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: Sid Tanaban &lt;sidban2@...=\r\nm&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re: [Read_Alphabet] Re: I&#39;d like to be able to write the =\r\nprefixes com- and con- as contractions&lt;br&gt;To: Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Date: Friday, August 19, 2011, 8:04 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv860747502&quot;&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv860747502ygrp-text=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=\r\n=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;top&quot; style=3D&quot;font:inherit;&quot;&gt;Mr. Read was q=\r\nuite willing to abandon the Shaw&#39;s alphabet and use other letters that he t=\r\nhought more suitable. &nbsp;It was his opinion -- not a scientific rule! &n=\r\nbsp;My opinion would be if you do not like &quot;o&quot; then use the &quot;uh&quot; of Shaw&#39;s =\r\nalphabet. &nbsp;Actually, I recognize that very easily. &nbsp;I studied Sha=\r\nw&#39;s alphabet before QS and think some of the letters are much more aestheti=\r\ncally drawn. &nbsp;And, that would be my viewpoint about other questions ab=\r\nout such a matter. &nbsp;Mr. Read may or may not have been dogmatic about w=\r\nhat he created but it is really preferable for your own use to choose what =\r\nis delightful and easy to read. &nbsp;After all, do you want to view this a=\r\ns one would view the Bible? &nbsp;The script is only a tool for one&#39;s own p=\r\nleasure and surely a minor change is not going to harm readability, particu=\r\nlarly when everyone\n is sounding\n out these words according to their own pa=\r\nrticular use of English anyway.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am sure someone will o=\r\nbject to what I have to say and I would be curious if someone feels that th=\r\nere is something I have overlooked. &nbsp;If so, please convey your thought=\r\n on it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sid&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Fri, 8/19/11, cossyrosario &lt;i&gt;&lt;co=\r\nssyrosario@...&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-le=\r\nft:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: cossyrosario &lt;cossyrosario@yah=\r\noo.co.in&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [Read_Alphabet] Re: I&#39;d like to be able to write t=\r\nhe prefixes com- and con- as contractions&lt;br&gt;To: Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&lt;br&gt;Date: Friday, August 19, 2011, 12:28 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv8607475=\r\n02&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv860747502ygrp-=\r\ntext&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;What is T.O.?&lt;br&gt;\nTraditional Orthodox?

The o when&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; written as in Latin letters (as a circle) has the sound of owe in=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nowe.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Therefore com- with the circle o would rhyme with c=\r\nomb, and con-&lt;br&gt;\nwith&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the circle o would rhyme with cone, wh=\r\nich is not what I want to.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, if I were m=\r\naking notes for myself, as is the case most of&lt;br&gt;\nthe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; time I=\r\n use QuikScript, I could certainly use the o as a private&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wor=\r\nk-around.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; What I have been using as an even sho=\r\nrter work-around for temporary&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; private notes (to-do list, not=\r\nes of a meeting discussion to be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; transcribed fairly soon on t=\r\nhe computer) is just the k as a prefix,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; thus kputer for compu=\r\nter, kshus for conscious, etc.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --=\r\n- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Sid Tanaban sid=\r\nban2@ wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; com or con can be writte=\r\nn in one stroke. =C3=82 Just write the &quot;o&quot;&lt;br&gt;\nas you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; would i=\r\nn latin letters and add the &quot;m&quot; =C3=82  Unfortunately, I have&lt;br&gt;\nno&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; idea how to do this on a computer.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sid&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Wed, 8/17/11, cossyrosario cossyrosario=\r\n@ wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: cossyrosario cossyrosa=\r\nrio@&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [Read_Alphabet] Re: I&#39;d like to be able to=\r\n write the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; prefixes com- and con- as contractions&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Date: Wednesday, August 17, 2011, 11:20 PM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you, Steve!&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In=\r\n my hurry to learn as much as possible as soon as possible, I&lt;br&gt;\nraced&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through the manual, and must have raced =\r\npast the section on com-&lt;br&gt;\ncon- as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nit must have seemed obvious, with nothing new to learn!
