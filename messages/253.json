I&#39;ve got <br/>\nmost of the letters down (at least in its &quot;junior&quot; form), but there <br/>\nare some letters that I&#39;m not sure how to use, and some sounds for <br/>\nwhich I&#39;m not sure which letter to use, for instance the common &quot;er&quot; <br/>\nsuffix, as in &quot;maker&quot;.  <br/>\n     Also, I was wondering how users of the alphabet deal with <br/>\ndifferent pronounciations due to differences in dialect.  Is there <br/>\na &quot;standard&quot; Read form for each English word, or would one simply <br/>\nwrite the words as his or her dialect pronounces them?<br/>\n     If these questions have been answered anywhere else on board, <br/>\ncould someone direct me to the thread they&#39;re in?
