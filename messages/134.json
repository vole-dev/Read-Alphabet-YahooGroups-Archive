  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-81541582\">To everyone:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have essentially completed setting up a new keyboard scheme for typing<br/>\nQuikscript building on the ideas that Jon Zuck proposed recently along<br/>\nwith some additions of my own.  The Keyman program allows me to type in<br/>\na scheme that is easy to remember due to its relationship to Roman, and<br/>\nKeyman functions as an interface altering the actual input so that the<br/>\nappropriate QS letters appear on the screen in the Jerome font.  Now<br/>\nthat I understand it somewhat, I realize why Keyman allows a file or<br/>\npost typed in this new scheme to be read by someone using the standard<br/>\nShavian mapping in a Shavian font:  Keyman functions like an overlay of<br/>\nthe existing Jerome mapping, which is the standard Shavian mapping plus<br/>\nthe extensions added to take advantage of the QS half-letters and<br/>\nligatures.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter using Keyman and this new typing scheme, I can assure you it will<br/>\nbe much easier to master than what we have been struggling with.  To<br/>\ntake advantage of this, you will have to download Keyman 3.1 from the<br/>\nwebsite tavultesoft.com.  It is free.  Then download the following files<br/>\nfrom Read_Alphabet:  ezqs.kmn, ezqson.bmp, ezqs.off.bmp and ezqs.notes<br/>\nThe first file contains the program that insructs Keyman how to alter<br/>\nyour input on the keyboard to the appropriate Jerome output.  The second<br/>\nand third file are bitmaps used as buttons on the screen to turn Keyman<br/>\non and off.  The last file explains the keystrokes used and<br/>\ncorresponding Jerome output.  The notes file is not completed yet, but<br/>\nyou can still download the others.  I upload the notes file as soon as I<br/>\ncan.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic idea is that almost all the consonants are typed as one would<br/>\nexpect.  The digraphs (sh, ch, th, zh,) as typed as they would be in<br/>\nRoman and the appropriate QS character is output.  The ligature letters<br/>\n(involving a vowel + &#39;r&#39;) are mapped to the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.<br/>\nAfter typing the number, you  type &#39;j&#39;, which acts as a &#39;flag.&#39;  Since<br/>\n&#39;j&#39; is struck with a strong finger and can only be used after certain<br/>\nconsonants, it is used as a &#39;flag&#39; key for other combinations as well.<br/>\nThe half-letters are produced by typing the appropriate letter<br/>\nimmediately followed by &#39;j.&#39;  This also produces the alternate &#39;n&#39;<br/>\ncharacter and the alternate schwa.  Respectively, &#39;nj&#39; and &#39;aj.&#39;  Since<br/>\n&#39;nj&#39; is a letter combination that can occur, when that is what one<br/>\nneeds, but the alternate &#39;n&#39; has been output to the screen, simply hit<br/>\nthe &#39;j&#39; a second time, and the output  shifts to &#39;nj&#39; as needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe vowels are triggered by typing combinations that are used in Roman.<br/>\nUsing the names in the QS manual, the following combinations give the<br/>\nrelated output.<br/>\nee, ea, ey = EAt;<br/>\nay, ai        = EIGHt<br/>\naa             = At<br/>\nie, yy        = I<br/>\noh             = OWE<br/>\noo             = fOOt<br/>\naw            = AWE<br/>\nah             = Ah<br/>\nou, ow      = OUt<br/>\noi, oy        = OY<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the letter sequence &#39;a+w&#39; and &#39;a+h&#39; can occur in English words,<br/>\nwhen the program gives you an &#39;Ah&#39; or &#39;AWE&#39; that you don&#39;t want, simply<br/>\nhit the &#39;h&#39; or &#39;w&#39; a second time, and the output will shift back to the<br/>\nseparate letters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only problem still remaining at this time that I am aware of is that<br/>\nthe two &quot;x&quot; forms were mapped by Jon to require the use of the &#39;alt&#39;<br/>\nkey, and I have not been able to map that to the &#39;x&#39; key as I had<br/>\nhoped.  It still works with Keyman, but you have to type &#39;alt&#39; 0232 or<br/>\n&#39;alt&#39; 0233 to get the &#39;x&#39; forms.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to see some posts back and forth using this new setup so we<br/>\ncan see how well it works and whether there are any bugs that need to be<br/>\nfixed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the fortuitous things about this scheme is that it works equally<br/>\nwell for junior and senior QS.
