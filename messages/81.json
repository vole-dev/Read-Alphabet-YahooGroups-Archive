Jerome went through quite a bit of evolution,<br/>\nand at first I was quite hesitant to go the distance of the half-letters,<br/>\nand all.

I think most people who are not adverse to cursive<br/>\nwriting :-) will eventually find Senior the more preferable one for personal<br/>\nhandwriting, which is the most practical use for a semi-private alphabet<br/>\nthat only a handful of people can read. But for the computer, in English, we<br/>\nusually only use cursive fonts for art, titles, special emphasis, and the<br/>\nfeeling of a &quot;personal touch.&quot;  On the other hand, many languages of world<br/>\nuse connected, cursive letters: Hindi, Bengali, Arabic, Aramaic.
