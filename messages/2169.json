With a bit of work, we can have all the classics in Quickscript in a matter of days. Doing so by hand produces the best results, but takes a long time. Using precompiled phonetic dictionaries is really fast, but tends to produce really poor results. Why not use a combined approach? A full plan in available in the files section of the project, so check it out if you&#39;re interested. This will be an opensource project from the get-go and anyone that wants to help is welcome. I&#39;m a horrible coder, but I&#39;ve been using QS for over five years and actually like to proofread documents.
