Obviously, a drop in the ocean.<br/>\n<br/>\nReturning to English:  I did not intend to claim it had discarded all <br/>\nunnecessary grammar, just that it was considerably simpler than other <br/>\nEuropean languages.  I have no experience with Asian languages so I cannot <br/>\ncompare them to English.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure if this is correct, but from some things I have read, it <br/>\nseems that languages reached a high level of grammatical complexity <br/>\nthousands of years ago, and that since then some languages have been <br/>\ndiscarding that needless complexity.  This seems counterintuitive to me.  I <br/>\nwould have expected that language would become more complex over time <br/>\ninstead of simpler.  I have read that the discarding of inflections in <br/>\nEnglish may have been prompted by the necessities of communication between <br/>\nthe Angles and Saxons (I believe) and Vikings who eventually settled in the <br/>\nnorth of Britain after centuries of raiding.  They all spoke germanic <br/>\ntongues with many similar root words, but the inflexions got in the way of <br/>\ncomprehension.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It is true that other European languages have far more inflexions.

However, if you compare it with certain non-European<br/>\n&gt;languages, it is still unnecessarily complex.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Indonesian, for instance, has no tenses. When it is important to indicate<br/>\n&gt;the time, Indonesians use words like &quot;already&quot; or &quot;tomorrow&quot;.

There are many irregular<br/>\n&gt;verbs (e.g. shake - shook - shaken).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would agree that some of these tenses are needlessly complex.  On the <br/>\nother hand, the preceding makes me wonder:  when an Indonesian uses <br/>\n&quot;tomorrow,&quot; meaning &quot;in the future&quot;, does he still signify the next day, or <br/>\ndoes it mean some unspecified future time?  And if the latter is the case, <br/>\nthen when he really means &quot;tomorrow,&quot; i.e. the next day, he would have to <br/>\nfurther specify that in some manner.  A speaker of a language using tenses <br/>\nmight find that needlessly complex.  Obviously, language is interwoven into <br/>\na culture so deeply that it is difficult to look with fresh eyes at a <br/>\nlanguage that is radically different from your own.  Do other cultures <br/>\nreally experience time differently from the way we do?  Does the lack of <br/>\ntenses in a language mean that the speaker does not view time as something <br/>\nthat passes -- that yesterday is forever gone and that tomorrow has not yet <br/>\narrived?  This manner of seeing the universe seems so strange to an English <br/>\nspeaker that it is difficult to believe in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we think of language as a code for communicating ideas, there are <br/>\nobviously methods that can compact the code.  Inflections enable more <br/>\ninformation to be packed into fewer words.  Word order becomes less <br/>\nimportant, as in Latin.  With fewer inflections, word order becomes more <br/>\nimportant, as in English.  I believe Chinese uses no inflections so word <br/>\norder is crucial.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny native speaker of a language has no trouble using it fluently, which is <br/>\nnot to say eloquently.  Simplification of grammar probably aids a <br/>\nnon-native speaker in attaining fluency, but it also condemns the native <br/>\nspeaker to a less efficient form of communication all his life if the <br/>\nsimplified grammar becomes the norm.  Of course, throughout history, the <br/>\nnon-native speaker was always vastly outnumbered by the native speakers so <br/>\nthey newcomers had little impact on the evolution of a language.  Might <br/>\nthat be changing now with the increasing use of English in the world?<br/>\n<br/>\nEnglish tenses may seem needlessly complicated to a speaker of a language <br/>\nwho gets by with fewer or no tenses, but the meaning, as you noted, <br/>\nsometimes has to clarified with the additional words specifying when <br/>\nsomething occurred.  I would suppose tenses seem so useful to us as a means <br/>\nof reducing additional explanations of when events occurred that they are <br/>\nworth effort of learning to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou did not mention it, but I can only assume you are not using Shawscript <br/>\nwith your students.  Can you differentiate how much of the difficulty they <br/>\nexperience in learning English is related to the grammar and how much to <br/>\nthe roman alphabet?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difficulty of learning a language is, I assume, closely related to what <br/>\nlanguage you already speak.  I assume it would be easier for me to <br/>\nlearn  German than it would be to learn Chinese since English is a germanic <br/>\nlanguage.  If we could compare all the languages of the world and rate them <br/>\non a scale indicating the difficulty in learning them, where would English <br/>\nappear?  I believe that English would not be one of the most difficult <br/>\nlanguages to learn.  Perhaps, it would be in the middle of the pack.  I <br/>\nwould be willing to bet that if the student was taught English with <br/>\nShawscript or Quikscript, they would make considerably faster progress than <br/>\nthey do with roman script.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;One question about the Read Alphabet: isn&#39;t it being overtaken by<br/>\n&gt;technology? Writing is increasingly being done on a keyboard, so there is<br/>\n&gt;less need for a cursive script. In fact, cursive type is less clear -<br/>\n&gt;especially on a computer screen - than normal type. I find Shavian fonts<br/>\n&gt;easier to read than the Read Alphabet.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am flummoxed about the name for this alphabet.  Reed called it <br/>\nQuikscript, and I have always used that term.  Some people did not care for <br/>\nthat.  Some liked Revised Shaw.  When I began this site,  I chose Read <br/>\nAlphabet, thinking it would honor its creator.  And some people did not <br/>\nlike that name.  At this point, I am still using Quikscript.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo my mind, the beauty of Quikscript really appears in the Senior version <br/>\n(as Read termed it).  Junior Quikscript keeps all the letters <br/>\nseparate.  Senior Quikscript permits all letter joining that occurs <br/>\nnaturally, i.e. without additional connecting lines.  This means the <br/>\nletters always retain their normal shapes.  One letter will connect to the <br/>\nnext  when the first letters ends at the point where the next letter begins.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Cursive&quot; may not be the best word to describe QS&#39;s appearance since in <br/>\nroman writing that term implies the use of connecting lines which change <br/>\nthe appearance of the letters.  (I have seen recent high school graduates <br/>\nuse a connecting hump in front of an &quot;m&quot; (intended in cursive to connect <br/>\nthe letter to a preceding letter) even when the &quot;m&quot; is at the beginning of <br/>\na word.  Thus, you get a peculiar three-humped letter that looks bizarre to <br/>\nme.  And they will write &quot;n&quot; with two humps no matter where it appears.)  I <br/>\nused the term cursive because many letters are connected to each other as <br/>\nopposed to Shavian where they are all separate as in printing.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding technology:  while it is true that many people write with <br/>\nkeyboards, that does not prevent a font such as Jerome from being <br/>\nattractive and perfectly usable with a keyboard.  It reproduces a good deal <br/>\nof the spirit of handwritten QS and is perfectly legible.  QS&#39;s letters <br/>\nwere designed to connect easily.  The roman alphabet was not.  And I <br/>\nbelieve pens and pencils are in no danger of disappearing.  Most of us <br/>\nstill use them on a daily basis.  Perhaps, we should worry when <br/>\nvoice-recognition software really gets good. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI can read Shavian, but I&#39;m much faster at QS since I&#39;ve been using it for <br/>\n25 years and gave up Shavian in 1974 or so.  QS is perfectly legible.  I <br/>\nwould expect that you just haven&#39;t had the practice with QS that you&#39;ve had <br/>\nwith Shavian.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaige</div>",
