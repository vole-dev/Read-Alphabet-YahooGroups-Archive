For example, &quot;j&quot; combined with a following letter on \n&gt; a mapped keyboard to shift to another letter.  This works better than \n&gt; using the shift key all the time because your right forefinger is over \n&gt; the &quot;j&quot; so it is faster to hit it than to go to the shift key.  It \n&gt; also makes more sense to me than attempting to have a new keyboard \n&gt; manufactured.  I cannot believe that would cost effective for a very \n&gt; long time, i.e. until we need a lot more keyboards than we would at \n&gt; present.  The other problem with that is that people aren&#39;t always at \n&gt; the same computer.
