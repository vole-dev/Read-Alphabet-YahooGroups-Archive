  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1864946417\">I&#39;m proposing a new approach based on grouping the 27 lexical sets into<br/>\ndifferent groups and then explaining how to use each group.<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup I: Simple cases<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can unambiguously write KIT with It, DRESS with Et, TRAP with At, STRUT<br/>\nwith Utter (stressed), COMMA with Utter (unstressed), FOOT with Foot,<br/>\nFLEECE with Eat, FACE with Eight, PALM with Ah, GOAT with Owe, GOOSE with<br/>\nOoze, PRICE with I, CHOICE with Oy, and MOUTH with Out.  In Australia<br/>\nand New Zealand, STRUT is pronounced like a shortened version of PALM.<br/>\nHowever, QS can&#39;t represent this distinction, so Ah is used for both.<br/>\nAs for the New Zealand accent pronouncing KIT like COMMA, it&#39;s easy<br/>\nfor NZ speakersto write It for the stressed vowel and Utter for the<br/>\nunstressed one.<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup II:  Historic /r/<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lexical sets which involve historic /r/, namely NURSE, START, SQUARE,<br/>\nNEAR, NORTH, FORCE, CURE, and LETTER, are always going to be written<br/>\nwith Roe, so there will never be any *written* merger of these lexical<br/>\nsets with any others, even in non-rhotic dialects that don&#39;t pronounce<br/>\n/r/ in these positions.  For example, RP pronounces START like PALM,<br/>\nbut will write PALM words with Ah and START words with Ah-Roe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince there are only eight lexical sets and 15 vowels, there will need<br/>\nto be some more or less arbitrary conventions to determine which vowel<br/>\nis used to write which set.  START, NURSE, and LETTER are unquestionably<br/>\nAh-Roe, Utter-Roe (stressed), and Utter-Roe (unstressed).  This is true<br/>\neven in accents where LETTER is pronounced like COMMA, because LETTER<br/>\nwill have a Roe and COMMA will not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI failed to notice before that Read prescribes Eight-Roe for SQUARE (at<br/>\nthe bottom of the alphabet page), though Et-Roe would serve as well,<br/>\nas the distinction between Eight and Et is neutralized before /r/.<br/>\nBy analogy, I&#39;d be inclined to write NEAR and CURE with Eat-Roe and<br/>\n(Ye-)Ooze-Roe, the historical pronunciations, although It-Roe and<br/>\n(Ye-)Foot-Roe would work too for the same reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat leaves NORTH and FORCE, which are merged in most accents.  However,<br/>\nthose which still keep them separate use Awe+Roe and Owe+Roe respectively.<br/>\nAll we have to do, then, is to say that if you pronounce FORCE like<br/>\nNORTH, use one (to be decided) for both -- Awe+Roe is the historical<br/>\npronunciation.  In some accents, CURE is pronounced like NORTH (and<br/>\nFORCE), in which case Awe+Roe is suitable for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup III: BATH and CLOTH<br/>\n<br/>\nThese two lexical sets never correspond to a unique sound: they are always<br/>\nmerged with something.  Either BATH is like TRAP or BATH is like PALM;<br/>\nin the former case you write BATH words with At, the same vowel as TRAP<br/>\nwords; in the latter case, with Ah, the same vowel as PALM words.<br/>\n<br/>\nCLOTH is analogous: it&#39;s either pronounced like LOT or like CLOTH.<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup IV:  LOT and THOUGHT<br/>\n<br/>\nSome accents pronounce LOT separately, in which case Ox is used for it.<br/>\nOthers pronounce it like PALM, in which case Ah is used.  Likewise, some<br/>\naccents pronounce THOUGHT separately, in which case Awe is used for it.<br/>\nOthers pronounce it like PALM, in which case Ah is used.  Some merge<br/>\nboth LOT and THOUGHT with PALM.<br/>\n<br/>\nGROUP V:  HAPPY<br/>\n<br/>\nRead prescribes It for this, though Eat is much more common (again,<br/>\nIt and Eat are neutralized in final position, as well as before Ing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat accounts for all the lexical sets, and explains how to use all<br/>\nfifteen QS vowels.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nA rabbi whose congregation doesn&#39;t want         John Cowan<br/>\nto drive him out of town isn&#39;t a rabbi,         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ccil.org/~cowan\">http://www.ccil.org/~cowan</a><br/>\nand a rabbi who lets them do it                 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cowan@...\">cowan@...</a><br/>\nisn&#39;t a man.    --Jewish saying</div>",
