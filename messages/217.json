  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1441559404\">I&#39;ve been listening in for a while, but this is my first post, so here<br/>\ngoes. You mentioned making an abjad that was for english but was as<br/>\nflowing as arabic.  Why not just use arabic then? If you wanted to<br/>\nsimplify it you could use mostly the medial forms and take out the other<br/>\nthree in most cases. They have more consonants than we do anyway, so the<br/>\nones where it would be difficult to identify or ones where you didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant so many dots you could take out or change. It might also be<br/>\nadvisiable to take out the forms that drop unnecessarily below the line<br/>\nsince that takes up space that dit doesn&#39;t need to. I&#39;m not sure if<br/>\narabic diacritics would work as they are, but with a little<br/>\nsupplementation they chould do. This has the advantage of already<br/>\nexisting, being as flowing as arabic, and making english somewhat more<br/>\naccessible to a quite a few people in the world. On the subject of<br/>\nquickscript, I really have no idea what to do with it, but if somebody<br/>\nwould send me an email (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:magnet10@...\">magnet10@...</a>) or refer to somewhere that<br/>\ntalked about which letters connected how, that would go a long way to<br/>\nmaking me funcitonal in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nColin Grant<br/>\n\r<br/>\n________________________________________________________________\r<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!\r<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!\r<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
