When you choose <br/>\nThothUni, you choose both HTML and Unicode characters. Keep in mind that <br/>\nUnicode just assigns a number to each character. The letter &quot;n&quot; gets <br/>\nnumber 110, for example. The letter  \u00e9 gets the higher number of 233. In <br/>\ncontrast to these two examples, Quikscript has not real Unicode values. <br/>\nThe consortium that maintains Quikscript has not given Quikscript any <br/>\nnumbers at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to work around this, we have used the numbers from the private <br/>\nUnicode area, a set of numbers the Unicode consortium set aside just for <br/>\nsuch a purpose. There are no letters assigned to these numbers so that <br/>\ngroups like us can assign letters to them. However, another group can <br/>\nassign different letters to these same numbers. Unlike the standard <br/>\nUnicode values (such as with the letter &quot;n&quot;), there is no agreed upon <br/>\nway to use the letters in the private group.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you type QS in your emails, you are typing something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;p fontface=&quot;Thoth Unicode&quot;&gt;\ue650<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe stuff in the &quot;&lt;&quot; is the HTML code. Your emailer won&#39;t display this, <br/>\nbecause it is instructions on how to display the text. You should see <br/>\none box after the &lt;&gt; tags. This is the letter Pipe with the value of <br/>\n58960. When an emailer sees the 58960 character, it tries to match it <br/>\nwith a letter. But since there is no agreed upon letters for the 58960 <br/>\nnumber, it poses a problem. If the emailer can get the Thoth font, then <br/>\nit can find a letter. But if the emailer doesn&#39;t like to use other <br/>\nfonts, or if the HTML tag has somehow not gotten transfered, then there <br/>\nwill be no letter, and all&#39;s you will see is a box.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we get our own Unicode values, we won&#39;t need to depend on using any <br/>\nparticular font. Once QS has its own values for a few years, standard <br/>\nfonts should, at least in theory, start including letters for it. That <br/>\nmeans any Unicode font would work. If I sent a message to you in plain <br/>\ntext, and  your emailer opened it with an updated version of a Unicode <br/>\nTimes font, it should still display the QS characters. In that case, you <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t need HTML at all. When an emailer sees the number xxx (where <br/>\nxxx reflects the new number we will get if our proposal is accepted), it <br/>\nknows what letter to match it to, unlike now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trick is actually getting our own Unicode values.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul</div>",
