This exercise has only<br/>\ndeepened my appreciation of the inherent artistry and expressive power<br/>\nof this alphabet. I think I&#39;m starting to sense the outline of a new<br/>\nQS manual taking shape.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that the decisions you outline may only be determined<br/>\nin the long run by users who make individual stylistic choices. Some<br/>\nchoices, such as my own choice to use &#39;Other&#39; instead of &#39;Thither&#39; (to<br/>\nuse Jon Zuck&#39;s nomenclature) are purely aesthetic. Other choices have<br/>\nan impact on communication across dialects.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally don&#39;t feel we should be constrained by all of Read&#39;s<br/>\noriginal choices. Here are my votes for the cases you raise (for my<br/>\nown accent, West Coast American):<br/>\n<br/>\n1) SQUARE: use &#39;Ed&#39; + &#39;Roar&#39;. (I&#39;m open to persuasion.)<br/>\n2) NEAR: use &#39;Eat&#39; + &#39;Roar&#39;. (I&#39;m open to persuasion.)<br/>\n3) CURE: use &#39;Yo-yo&#39; + &#39;Wool&#39; + &#39;Roar&#39;. (I&#39;m open to persuasion.)<br/>\n4) NORTH and FORCE: use &#39;Oak&#39; + &#39;Roar&#39;. (I am less open to persuasion.)<br/>\n5) HAPPY: use &#39;Eat&#39;. (I&#39;m not open to persuasion.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have incorporated these choices into the table that I use when I<br/>\nwrite in QS. I haven&#39;t polished it up for general distribution, but<br/>\nhere it is anyway:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://staff.washington.edu/freeman/qs/qs_table_jerome.pdf\">http://staff.washington.edu/freeman/qs/qs_table_jerome.pdf</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTed<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 6, 2007 5:59 PM, John Cowan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cowan@...\">cowan@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m proposing a new approach based on grouping the 27 lexical sets into<br/>\n&gt;  different groups and then explaining how to use each group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Group I: Simple cases<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  We can unambiguously write KIT with It, DRESS with Et, TRAP with At, STRUT<br/>\n&gt;  with Utter (stressed), COMMA with Utter (unstressed), FOOT with Foot,<br/>\n&gt;  FLEECE with Eat, FACE with Eight, PALM with Ah, GOAT with Owe, GOOSE with<br/>\n&gt;  Ooze, PRICE with I, CHOICE with Oy, and MOUTH with Out.
