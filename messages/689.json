How do I write the word &quot;a,&quot; as in &quot;a car,&quot; &quot;a birthday,&quot; etc.?  I <br/>\nusually use character 32, but I could see arguments for character 29 <br/>\nor even 36.  Is there a standard?  Does Read address this anywhere?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Should I include a character 26 before a character 21 in a gerund <br/>\nsuch as &quot;eating&quot; or drop the 26?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. The &quot;Our Father&quot; text in this group includes an upside-down <br/>\ncharacter 27 after character 18 in the word &quot;we.&quot;  Is this an <br/>\nalternate form of the letter that Read suggested, or just a printing <br/>\nerror?<br/>\n<br/>\n4. What should be done with words that have multiple, legitimate <br/>\npronunciations?  For example &quot;potato,&quot; or &quot;amen.&quot;  (1,38,3,29,3,38) <br/>\nvs. (1,38,3,32,3,38) or (29,22,28,23) vs. (32,22,28,23)?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n6,25,28,6</div>",
