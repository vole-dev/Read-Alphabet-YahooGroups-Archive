I enjoy\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; some of the advantages of both.  Read&#39;s extension of abreviations\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; abreviated words in Quickscript seem wonderful.  However, I find the\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; small &quot;curleys&quot; in the type version of Jerome hard on my eyes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I really appreciate the hard work done on Jerome, but believe\n&gt; &gt; Quickscript readers could also do with a font that does not look\n&gt; like\n&gt; &gt; penmanship.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From reading Read&#39;s booklet on Quickscript, it appears that most of\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the half letter and joinings were instituted to make writing with a\n&gt; &gt; pen easier, not reading easier.  Much like script penmanship, I\n&gt; &gt; believe that most of them detract from the readability of the text\n&gt; &gt; when the text is in an electronic version.  (BTW, I gave up on\n&gt; script\n&gt; &gt; writing in the seventh grade about 36 years ago and have been\n&gt; &gt; printing ever since so that my handwriting can be easily read.  I\n&gt; use\n&gt; &gt; the computer to write letters for the same reason.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I can not imagine wanting to read a font on the computer which\n&gt; &gt; attempts to mimic script...  I know they exist, but to prefer this\n&gt; &gt; for everyday reading!  No thanks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have been thinking along two lines.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First, is there already a version of Quickscript True Type font\n&gt; which\n&gt; &gt; looks more like the Junior Quickscript of Read&#39;s manual?  If not, I\n&gt; &gt; may invest a little time and come up with one.  I think it could\n&gt; &gt; improve readability in the way that ghoti and lionspaw are very\n&gt; &gt; readable Shavian scripts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Second, is there a way to program the keyboard interface to scan for\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; combination letters other than shift, ctl and alt?  I recently\n&gt; worked\n&gt; &gt; on a 7 key keyboard that used &quot;chord fingerings&quot;  for letters.\n&gt; Chord\n&gt; &gt; fingerings seem like a natural for phonetic languages like\n&gt; &gt; Quickscript.  It is easy enough to remember cap T for &quot;theater&quot; but\n&gt; &gt; cap Y for &quot;oil&quot;??  Would it not be nice to just press the o and i\n&gt; &gt; keys?  The computer would run the following algorhythm when you\n&gt; &gt; pressed the o key... hmmm... o key, must be an o, ... no the i key\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; also pressed must be an &quot;oil&quot;  now wait for the next letter press.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have not worked the keyboard interface to see if this kind of\n&gt; chord\n&gt; &gt; keying could be instituted within the present operating systems or\n&gt; &gt; not.  Any computer programmmers with feedback?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rick\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In Read_Alphabet@y..., &quot;C.

I think a Read-based mapping is desireable,\nbut&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;on the other hand so is backward compatibility to Shavian--not\nso much to&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;lure them over, but to use their transliteration programs, which\nis why I&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;kept it in Jerome. (Bad as their mapping is, the fact that they\ncreated a&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;standard and built upon it is great.)&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;BTW, I realized that my key to the Second Shaw Alphabet, originally\nposted&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;to the Shavian group wasn&#39;t on the files in this group and the\nShavian&#39;s&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;copy was corrupted.&nbsp; I fixed it and posted it to both.&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Shalom v&#39;Tovah,&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Jon&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://surf.to/frimmin&quot;&gt;http://surf.to/frimmin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;It is more necessary to love much than to think much;&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;always do that which impels you most to love.&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Two thoughts on Jerome and computer typing in quickscript:&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; I have only recently begun to read Shavian and Quickscript.&nbsp;\nI enjoy&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; some of the advantages of both.&nbsp; Read&#39;s extension of abreviations\nand&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; abreviated words in Quickscript seem wonderful.&nbsp; However,\nI find the&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; small &quot;curleys&quot; in the type version of Jerome hard on my eyes.&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; I really appreciate the hard work done on Jerome, but believe&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; Quickscript readers could also do with a font that does not look\nlike&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; penmanship.&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; &gt;From reading Read&#39;s booklet on Quickscript, it appears that\nmost of&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; the half letter and joinings were instituted to make writing\nwith a&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; pen easier, not reading easier.&nbsp; Much like script penmanship,\nI&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; believe that most of them detract from the readability of the\ntext&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; when the text is in an electronic version.&nbsp; (BTW, I gave\nup on script&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; writing in the seventh grade about 36 years ago and have been&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; printing ever since so that my handwriting can be easily read.&nbsp;\nI use&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; the computer to write letters for the same reason.)&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; I can not imagine wanting to read a font on the computer which&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; attempts to mimic script...&nbsp; I know they exist, but to prefer\nthis&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; for everyday reading!&nbsp; No thanks.&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; I have been thinking along two lines.&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; First, is there already a version of Quickscript True Type font\nwhich&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; looks more like the Junior Quickscript of Read&#39;s manual?&nbsp;\nIf not, I&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; may invest a little time and come up with one.&nbsp; I think\nit could&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; improve readability in the way that ghoti and lionspaw are very&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; readable Shavian scripts.&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; Second, is there a way to program the keyboard interface to scan\nfor&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; combination letters other than shift, ctl and alt?&nbsp; I recently\nworked&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; on a 7 key keyboard that used &quot;chord fingerings&quot;&nbsp; for letters.&nbsp;\nChord&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; fingerings seem like a natural for phonetic languages like&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; Quickscript.&nbsp; It is easy enough to remember cap T for &quot;theater&quot;\nbut&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; cap Y for &quot;oil&quot;??&nbsp; Would it not be nice to just press the\no and i&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; keys?&nbsp; The computer would run the following algorhythm when\nyou&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; pressed the o key... hmmm... o key, must be an o, ... no the\ni key is&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; also pressed must be an &quot;oil&quot;&nbsp; now wait for the next letter\npress.&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; I have not worked the keyboard interface to see if this kind\nof chord&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; keying could be instituted within the present operating systems\nor&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; not.&nbsp; Any computer programmmers with feedback?&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; Rick&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt; --- In Read_Alphabet@y..., &quot;C.
