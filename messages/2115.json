  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1026854715\">Hello everybody,<br/>\nthis is a late reply to Ian&#39;s mail from May. At the time I was just<br/>\nabout to start learning Quikscript and made some notes to myself in<br/>\nlieu of a reply.<br/>\nI now finally published those notes on my blog<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rethinktheworld.blogspot.com/search/label/quikscript\">http://rethinktheworld.blogspot.com/search/label/quikscript</a>&gt; and I<br/>\nwant to send this to you with my personal history of Quikscript use so<br/>\nfar.<br/>\nFirst, I have to say that I was fluently reading and writing English<br/>\nfor a long time without even knowing that its spelling is difficult.<br/>\nThe reason is that I never really spoke the language -- I knew it only<br/>\nthrough writing. After I moved to Canada in 2007 I noticed that there<br/>\nwas something wrong with English, but I didn&#39;t know what it was. In<br/>\n2008 I first read about English Spelling Reform and I instantly knew<br/>\nthat I would have to investigate this further and find one reform<br/>\nproposal that would work for me. I finally took the time to<br/>\ninvestigate all those proposals last winter (ironically that was when<br/>\nI studied Chinese in Taiwan). I found that Quikscript is by far the<br/>\nbest proposal on how to practically write English and decided to learn<br/>\nit as soon as I would go back to Canada.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have learned Quikscript, I am using it to write my diary, for<br/>\nshopping lists, and other handwritten notes. Quikscript has helped me<br/>\nalready to improve my pronunciation and to gain back respect for<br/>\nEnglish as a language! Once I can write it properly, English becomes a<br/>\nlanguage of its own, instead of a mix of Old Germanic, French, and<br/>\nLatin, all weirdly pronounced.<br/>\nObviously, the benefits of a simplified spelling are much less for<br/>\npeople who have already wasted many years in school to learn the<br/>\ncomplicated spelling and who master it quite well. Quikscript will be<br/>\nmost beneficial for people that haven&#39;t learned to write yet, that is,<br/>\nchildren and non-native speakers. I think that both groups can benefit<br/>\nmuch from learning Quikscript, even if they also have to learn the<br/>\ncurrent English writing with the Latin alphabet. I think that the<br/>\nfuture of Quikscript lies in the people who will learn both writing<br/>\nsystems; Quikscript first; and who will invariably feel that<br/>\nQuikscript is the true written version of the English language, while<br/>\nthe traditional spelling is just a way to communicate with people who<br/>\nhaven&#39;t learned this proper way.<br/>\nMy children will definitely be fluent readers and writers of<br/>\nQuikscript before they start going to school. Being able to express<br/>\ntheir language visually will make it easier for them to memorize the<br/>\narcane rules and exceptions of traditional spelling. (Just as most<br/>\nforeigners use IPA or some other means of writing the pronunciation of<br/>\nwords to make language learning easier.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, my next step is now to become fluent in reading Quikscript<br/>\nand to develop a consistent and clear accent (or non-accent) for<br/>\nspeaking and writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nthat&#39;s my two (Euro-)cents so far,<br/>\nJack</div>",
