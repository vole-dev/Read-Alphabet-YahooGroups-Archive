I met with Kingsley Read on a couple of occasions and I corresponded with him for over two years in the mid 60&#39;s in a group which consisted of a Northern irishman, a southern Englishman, Kingsley Read and myself.  The whole point of Quikscript is that it is capable of reflecting local ways of speaking - be it American, Australian, Standard English or whatever.  It is a phonetic alphabet and that assumes that it will be written as it is spoken.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe abbreviations in Senior QS are the only things that are standardised and they mostly ignore vowels.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoira<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;guanolto&quot; &lt;scott@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;stratocat6969&quot; &lt;john-bergsma@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your reply.

I can still stare in the direction of a QS text and the meaning doesn&#39;t jump out at me as quickly and inavoidably as it does with orthodox writing. All the best to you with QS.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kind Regards,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Scott<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
