On the whole, Quikscript works quite well for German.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, we have those umlaut letters (\u00e4\u00f6\u00fc) in short and long<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pronunciation. Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Greetings,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hermann<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have experimented quite a lot with adapting QS to Swedish,<br/>\n&gt; and have found it necessary to reshuffle the values of the<br/>\n&gt; vowel letters quite a lot.  I almost ran out of letters, saving<br/>\n&gt; the day only by assigning #18 and #20 to long and short<br/>\n&gt; Swedish _y_, and by inventing a &#39;long&#39; counterpart of #38<br/>\n&gt; looking like a combination of the counterclockwise version<br/>\n&gt; of #36 + #31, which works only because #31 is assigned to _a_<br/>\n&gt; and #31 to long _\u00e4_, and these two vowels dont really occur in<br/>\n&gt; succession.  Swedish has one pair of long/short vowel more than<br/>\n&gt; German, but OTOH German has its three diphthongs _ei au eu_<br/>\n&gt; which need their signs beside the eight pairs of long/short<br/>\n&gt; vowels.  So in sum German needs 19 vowel letters while Swedish<br/>\n&gt; needs only 18.  Maybee you could skip the _e/\u00e4_ distinction<br/>\n&gt; which carries no great functional load in German -- at least<br/>\n&gt; short _e/\u00e4_ being not distinguished at all for the vast majority<br/>\n&gt; of speakers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My vowel letter assignments are as follows, taking into consideration<br/>\n&gt; both the frequency of the vowel sounds in Swedish text -- wanting<br/>\n&gt; to assign the simplest signs to the most frequent vowels -- *and*<br/>\n&gt; trying not to stray too far from the English values at least for the<br/>\n&gt; short vowels:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;           Short       Long<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i        #26         #27<br/>\n&gt; e        #28         #29<br/>\n&gt; \u00e4        #30         #31<br/>\n&gt; \u00f6        #32         #33<br/>\n&gt; \u00e5 (o)    #34         #35<br/>\n&gt; a        #36         #37<br/>\n&gt; o (u)    #38         #36+#31<br/>\n&gt; u (\u00fc)    #39         #40<br/>\n&gt; y        #18         #20<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Corresponding German sound values are in parentheses.<br/>\n&gt; In actuality it is Swedish _y_ that corresponds to<br/>\n&gt; German _\u00fc_, while Swedish _u_ is a sound intermediate<br/>\n&gt; between _y, \u00f6, u_ (a roundedf central vowel for the<br/>\n&gt; phonetically inclined).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d suggest the following assignments for German:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;           Short       Long<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i        #26         #27<br/>\n&gt; e/\u00e4      #28         #29<br/>\n&gt; \u00f6        #30         #31<br/>\n&gt; o        #34         #35<br/>\n&gt; a        #36         #37<br/>\n&gt; u        #39         #40<br/>\n&gt; \u00fc        #18         #20<br/>\n&gt; ei/ai                #32<br/>\n&gt; eu/\u00e4u                #33<br/>\n&gt; au                   #38<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The reassignment of _\u00f6_ compared to Swedish is<br/>\n&gt; because of the high frequency of _\u00f6_ in German,<br/>\n&gt; which makes it more convenient to assign to a<br/>\n&gt; simpler sign.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Since Swedish _j_ unlike the English /j/ (&#39;y&#39;) can<br/>\n&gt; occur in any position in the word, notably at the<br/>\n&gt; end of a word after any (short) vowel QS #17 is not<br/>\n&gt; suitable for this sound, so I used #14, which has no<br/>\n&gt; counterpart in Swedish, for _j_ instead.  While German<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t need this particular reassignment it does need<br/>\n&gt; a better sign for its _ch_ sounds than the QS &#39;Loch&#39;<br/>\n&gt; letter, which isn&#39;t suitable for fast writing, so I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; suggest using #14 for German _ch_ instead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also German needs a letter for _z_ (&#39;ts&#39;); the best choice<br/>\n&gt; is probably #7.  Preferably there should also be a<br/>\n&gt; letter for _pf_, even though many speakers merge it with<br/>\n&gt; _f/v_; I dare not suggest #8 for _pf_, so probably the<br/>\n&gt; Senior QS abbreviated #1 + #9 is the best choice. Of<br/>\n&gt; course German _f/_ and _v_ should both be written with<br/>\n&gt; #9 and german _w_ with #10, and finally #12 for single<br/>\n&gt; _s_ and #11 for _ss/\u00df_, and silent _h_ is of course not<br/>\n&gt; to be written!
