If Britons, Americans and others start to write<br/>\nEnglish each according to their own spelling norm -- with QS<br/>\nor any other spelling reform -- they will soon cease to read<br/>\nand understand texts written in another country, and<br/>\nEnglish, or at any rate the QS community, will effectively<br/>\nbe split into several distinct languages, simply for the two<br/>\nreasons that it will be easier to read texts written<br/>\naccording to the same spelling norm as one self uses, and<br/>\nthat people tend to think of different spelling norms as<br/>\ndifferent languages.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main features of the AtOx spelling are:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lexical sets LOT-CLOTH-THOUGHT are all written with the<br/>\nQS letter {Q} [^1] and TRAP-BATH-FATHER are all written with<br/>\n{a}. The resulting -- hopefully simple -- spelling rule for<br/>\nspeakers who merge LOT-CLOTH-THOUGHT-FATHER (i.e. most North<br/>\nAmericans) is as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n   The default spelling for /A/ is {Q} (Ox), but spell it<br/>\n   with {a} (At) where the TO spelling is _a_ without a<br/>\n   following _u_ or _w_.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problematic set is those words where TO has _al_, but<br/>\nyou should mostly be safe using {Q} in these cases: even<br/>\n_palm_ has a minority pronunciation /pQlm/! There are<br/>\nsome words -- among them _knowledge_ with derivatives --<br/>\nwhere LOT has other spellings, but this group is small<br/>\nenough to be learned by rote (I don&#39;t have the list by me<br/>\nATM I&#39;m afraid).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason for not distinguishing THOUGHT from LOT is<br/>\nmainly that<br/>\n<br/>\n   - it simplifies the above spelling rule -- you don&#39;t need<br/>\n     to introduce subrules for when /A/ is spelled _au, aw,<br/>\n     augh, ough_.<br/>\n   - the CLOTH set straddles the boundary, being pronounced<br/>\n     with /Q/ and belonging with LOT in some accents and<br/>\n     pronounced with /O/ and belonging with THOUGHT in other<br/>\n     accents. Merging the three sets allows everyone to spell<br/>\n     CLOTH words the same way. (There is of course a third<br/>\n     group of accents where all three sets have /A/ -- the<br/>\n     uniform spelling with {Q} will be a simplification for<br/>\n     them too.)<br/>\n   - the functional load[^2] of the LOT-THOUGHT distinction<br/>\n     is low in those accents which make it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe TRAP and FATHER sets are also not distinguished, since<br/>\nthe functional load of that distinction is small, and is<br/>\nmissing for many speakers in the North of England, Scotland<br/>\nand Northern Ireland, not to mention many ESL speakers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn exception is made for the START and NORTH-FORCE sets for<br/>\ntwo reasons:<br/>\n<br/>\n   - These sets are pronounced with /A/ and /O/ respectively<br/>\n     in all major accents of English, and<br/>\n   - The QS combinations {Qr} and {ar} are awkward to write<br/>\n     compared to {Or} and {Ar} (although IMO {O} and {A} are<br/>\n     more difficult to write than {Q} and {a} in many other<br/>\n     contexts).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were to base an inter-English spelling reform on some<br/>\nanother alphabet than QS I might also merge STRUT-FOOT or<br/>\neven all of STRUT-FOOT- GOOSE, but Read&#39;s grounds for using<br/>\nthe letter {y} as he did, for both /V/ and /y/ and with {yr}<br/>\nfor /3(r)/ were quite solid, and after all most speakers of<br/>\nEnglish do distinguish STRUT from FOOT, so I see no pressing<br/>\nneed deviate from Read&#39;s practice in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne possible reform would be to write FOOT-GOOSE alike with<br/>\n{U} and use {u} for /ju/: it would make another major<br/>\ndifference between British and American English less<br/>\ndisturbing: in words like _tune, duke, suit, nude_ (i.e.<br/>\nwhere &#39;long _u_&#39; follows _t, d, s, n_ and at least<br/>\ntheoretically _z_) Britons pronounce _u_ as /ju/ but<br/>\nAmericans pronounce it as /u/, which would make a spelling<br/>\nwithout an explicit {j} desirable. Moreover some accents in<br/>\nBritain have a true diphthong /IU/ wherever other accents<br/>\nhave &#39;long _u_&#39;, including words like _lute_ and _rude_, so<br/>\nthat for them a spelling with a {j} in these words will be<br/>\nas inappropriate as a spelling which renders _u_ in _tune_<br/>\nand _lute_ differently. To abandon Read&#39;s {j_u} ligature<br/>\nwould however change word outlines radically, and the<br/>\nrequired spelling rule is simple as is:<br/>\n<br/>\n   Write TO &#39;long _u_&#39; with {j_u} except after _l_ and _r_.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmericans will have to remember that {j} after {t, d, n} is<br/>\nsilent, and to insert it appropriately, much as non-rhotic<br/>\nspeakers have to insert {r}. For speakers of /IU/ accents QS<br/>\nspelling was and will be rather illogical, but they will<br/>\nhave to defer to the majority.<br/>\n<br/>\nNotes:<br/>\n<br/>\n[^1]: In the following QS letters and spellings are given<br/>\n     according to QS-SAMPA and enclosed in curly braces {lYk<br/>\n     DIs}, TO letters and spellings are given between<br/>\n     underscores _like this_.
