  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1203954930\">Hello all. This is long {winded} email on (I think) a new topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI joined this group a few days ago and have spent a bit of time <br/>\nreading most of the messages since 2k1 (yes, my eyes are tired). I&#39;ve <br/>\nalso taken a look at the posted files. I must say that I admire the <br/>\nwork you&#39;ve all done in pushing Quickscript into the 21st Century.<br/>\n<br/>\nA bit about me; I&#39;ve been in the workplace over 30 years doing <br/>\nvarious things. Most recently I claim the dubious role of software <br/>\nindustry drone with a background in web, database, and application <br/>\nprogramming, localization, as well as software and hardware technical <br/>\nwriting. I have university degrees in Creative Writing and Library <br/>\nScience, for what they are worth.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor decades I&#39;ve kept a diary -- first on paper, then using key entry <br/>\non computer, then using palm pilot graffiti. For the past 18 months, <br/>\ndue to my work requirements, I&#39;ve used a combination of a tablet pc <br/>\n(cursive) and Windows mobile phone pc (again, using graffiti). <br/>\nNeedless to say, I sync heavily between them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I first started using graffiti 8 years ago, I recognized the <br/>\nutility that a true shorthand-base input system would provide to me <br/>\nin my personal writings. Going from paper to keyboard was a leap <br/>\nforward as far as efficiency was concerned (I type a casual 40-60 wpm <br/>\non my best days); however going from keyboard to graffiti was a step <br/>\nback -- even when incorporating predictive dictionaries, my input is <br/>\npretty slow, requiring a significant time invenstment (there is a <br/>\nchair in a certain pub nicknamed the &#39;Tungsten&#39; chair, since I sat <br/>\nthere at length many nights journalling on my Palm Pilot and tipping <br/>\npints).<br/>\n<br/>\nUp to this point, I made no move to invest time in learning any <br/>\nshorthand. What was the point? I&#39;d have to transcribe it by hand <br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, with the tablet pc&#39;s incredibly sophisticated ability to <br/>\nrecognize cursive (it was able to recognize my rather sloppy <br/>\nhandwriting and render into English (US) with *no* training) my dream <br/>\nof being able to write in shorthand and have on-demand conversion to <br/>\ntext (on not -- as some have pointed out here, shorthand is currently <br/>\nas good as encryption for the 90% case) is close to reality. The work <br/>\nbeing done here on fonts and Unicode is the last piece of the puzzle. <br/>\nBravo!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn recent weeks my workload has lightened a bit I&#39;ve been able to <br/>\nspend some time researching viable shorthand systems, with the <br/>\ninevitable discovery of Quickscript. It satisfies my personal and <br/>\nselfish requirements of being an effective, logical, sensible, and <br/>\nlearnable system. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve read this far, congratulations, I&#39;m finally getting to the <br/>\nmy questions. <br/>\n<br/>\n1. My anticipated model of usage (once I&#39;m competent in Quickscript) <br/>\nis as follows:<br/>\n  a. Write in Quickscript on either my tablet or mobile pc.<br/>\n  b. Convert to my electronic locale of choice (English (US)) if <br/>\n     I so choose.<br/>\n  c. I will never assume that anyone will ever read my raw notes. <br/>\n     If I want to share something, it will be as a conversion.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a reasonable model of usage? <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Given the above, I&#39;d say that I&#39;m intending to use Quickscript as <br/>\na personal tool. When sharing, I&#39;ll use standard spelling as (for <br/>\nlack of a better term) an *escrita franca*, which any literate <br/>\nEnglish speaker will understand over time, since locale-based <br/>\n(especially pronunciative) differences are greatly reduced. Since I&#39;m <br/>\nindifferent to anyone understanding my raw notes, questions about how <br/>\nto use, say, &#39;air&#39; &lt;I say err&gt; or &#39;array&#39; &lt;I say uh-ray&gt; are moot; in <br/>\nthe case of the relatively few gray instances I&#39;ve seen discussed in <br/>\nthis group I&#39;ll simply pick a usage that makes sense to me, stick <br/>\nwith it, and adjust my pc to do a custom correction/conversion in <br/>\nthose cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this an unreasonable expectation to set for myself? I don&#39;t have <br/>\nany qualms at spending a year or two becoming proficient in a <br/>\nslightly personalized Quickscript, and in so doing departing from a <br/>\nproposed universal standard: I&#39;m just like that (for instance, I use <br/>\na variant of the US-Dvorak keyboard that I&#39;ve designed to accommodate <br/>\nmy own typing quirks).<br/>\n<br/>\n3. And this, a comment. Given #2, my model actually becomes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  a. Write in a slightly customized Quickscript on either my <br/>\n     tablet or mobile pc.<br/>\n  b. Convert to my electronic locale of choice (English (US)) if <br/>\n     I so choose.<br/>\n  c. Apply customization to the result, since availble converters <br/>\n     will likely adhere to the standard being developed by members<br/>\n     of this group. (Or write a custom converter).<br/>\n  c. I will still never assume that anyone will ever read my raw<br/>\n     notes. If I want to share something, it will be as a conversion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking this model, without an intelligent (or locale-based) <br/>\nconverter, is too much to ask the typical prospective Quicksort user <br/>\nof the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all for now. I&#39;m interested in thoughts about any one of these <br/>\nitems. As always, trim the response -- this email of mine has become <br/>\nbloated beyond belief. <br/>\n<br/>\nthanks<br/>\nscribbleodd</div>",
