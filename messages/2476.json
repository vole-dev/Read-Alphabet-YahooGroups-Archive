  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-349574196\">I find this conversation interesting as I speak RP much as KR did.  I will always write unstressed -i with IT and generally trailing -ly is unstressed.  In terms of ease of writing, LOW-IT is very easily written cursively whereas LOW-EAT requires a break.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the word &quot;creation&quot; contains three distinct syllables - cre-a-tion so I would write this as KAY-ROE-EAT-ATE-SHE-NO.<br/>\n<br/>\nI continue to maintain that QS should be written by users in their own method of speech, not using a rigid spelling system.  I do accept, however, that in print there may need to be some level of standardisation in order to make reading easier. However, when I read print that attempts to mimic dialect or accent, I have no difficulty in understanding what is meant nor do I have difficulty in word recognition (which is the art of adult reading).<br/>\n<br/>\nWord recognition, as has been shown by some of the silly circular emails where the letters are scrambled, depends largely upon the combination of consonants in the word with vowels taking a secondary place.  We can quite easily decipher a word from the consonants only - for example: scrmbld cnsnts - the introduction of vowels just makes this process easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrthodox script does not imply pronunciation of vowels - we all read the written word in our own dialect/accent.  QS gives us more of an opportunity to express that dialect/accent to the reader.  The fact that QS cannot in 40 letters represent all possible sounds is just not relevant - it does a much better job of it than orthodox script.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoira<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Timothy&quot; &lt;tim_rice09@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The reason I followed the convention of using IT for final, unstressed /i/ sounds is that the manual and Shavian writings before it reserve EAT for stressed /i/ (normally turned into the diphthong /ij/ or /i&#720;/ or /ii&#815;/ (pick your notation poison) in most dialects).
