The QS manual starts off with the reasons why<br/>\n&gt; trying to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; redesign the Roman alphabet just doesn&#39;t cut it. A new alphabet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was needed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem I see with standardized spelling is that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;English-speaking Peoples&quot; have no language academy to even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attempt to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enforce spelling changes as the language continues to evolve.<br/>\n&gt; That is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sort of how we got in this mess (TO) to begin with.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I may be abysmally ignorant of the extent of English dialects,<br/>\n&gt; but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suspect that for a very large majority of English speakers,<br/>\n&gt; i.e. the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ones clustered in the middle of the bell curve of English<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pronunciation,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we could get along just fine without a standardized spelling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; majority of the words we use on a daily basis are not going to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spelt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so peculiarly by someone from a different, but still one of<br/>\n&gt; the major<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speech communities that it would not be recognizable. To be sure,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are the outliers on that bell curve who would need to conform<br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speech to a dialect in broader use than their own such as they<br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hear on the BBC or from American news outlets. But for most of<br/>\n&gt; us, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doubt we would need spelling police. For example, if I write<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;schedule&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a &quot;k&quot; sound, and a Londoner reads it, I seriously doubt, he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have more than a moment&#39;s hesitation in deciphering the word even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; though<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he doesn&#39;t pronounce it that way.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If we start insisting that every word must be spelt in accordance<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an arbitrary standard that does not match anyone&#39;s speech<br/>\n&gt; completely,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then we will be back to looking up many words and memorizing their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spelling. It is my understanding that in Shakespeare&#39;s time,<br/>\n&gt; the idea<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of proper spelling did not exist, and the Bard was quite<br/>\n&gt; content to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spell a word one way today and differently tomorrow. That<br/>\n&gt; apparently<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t hold him back We all have been prejudiced by our<br/>\n&gt; schooling and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what Kingsley Read called the &quot;cultural fetish&quot; of spelling to<br/>\n&gt; reject<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the idea that we can spell words the way we want. If we go too far<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; astray, our readers won&#39;t understand, and we pay the price of not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; read. That by itself, forces a high level of conformism onto the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; situation, but to insist that we all have to spell in lockstep<br/>\n&gt; or be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; considered morons is quite a different matter.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen a number of people insist that we have to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; standardized<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spelling or we are doomed, but I doubt anyone has actually studied<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so we have no real data as to how an alternative English alphabet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; work if it did or did not use standardized spelling. For<br/>\n&gt; example, let<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; us assume that we don&#39;t insist on standardized spelling and that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; later found that that decision slowed the average reading speed by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5 or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 10 % (I doubt it would be any greater than that). Would that<br/>\n&gt; not be a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reasonable price to pay to avoid putting ourselves back in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; position<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of attempting to memorize how words should be spelt rather than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spelling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them the way they sound in speech? I believe it would,<br/>\n&gt; especially for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the dyslexics among us, who cannot deal with arbitrary spellings.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If a person occasionally is unsure how to spell a word because he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suspects he may pronounce it differently than others, he could<br/>\n&gt; always<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; look it up in a dictionary. This is better than trying to memorize<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spelling of virtually his entire vocabulary in order to have it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comply<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with an arbitrary standard of speech.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Paige<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; John Cowan wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; amd64_hacker scripsit:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I&#39;m for abbreviations in all texts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that since QS is meant to be &#39;heard&#39; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t matter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how the word is written but how it is read.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, yes, but that slows down reading to the speed of speech. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suspect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that rapid silent reading and standardized orthography go<br/>\n&gt; together --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we do know that fluent readers recognize familiar words by<br/>\n&gt; the total<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shape of the word, slowing down only when they must to read an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unfamilar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; word, and that this is equally true in languages that are<br/>\n&gt; rationally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spelled, irrationally spelled, or not spelled at all (like<br/>\n&gt; Chinese).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So if QS is going to become important for works meant to be read<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more than once (as opposed to shorthand/transcription uses), a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standardized orthography will have to evolve.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which immediately leads to the issue of dialects. One&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; obvious and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; natural phonetic orthography is another&#39;s stumbling block.<br/>\n&gt; (&quot;Hmm,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is it spelled &#39;theft&#39; or &#39;feft&#39;?&quot; &quot;Hmm, does this mean &#39;lord&#39; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;laud&#39;?&quot;) A universal orthography ends up needing to make more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distinctions<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than any one dialect actually needs, and thus to some extent<br/>\n&gt; becoming<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; artificial to all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; John Cowan cowan@... &lt;mailto:cowan%40ccil.org&gt; &lt;mailto:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cowan% &lt;mailto:cowan%25&gt;40ccil.org &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">http://40ccil.org</a><br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">http://40ccil.org</a>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Mr. Lane, if you ever wish anything that I can do, all you<br/>\n&gt; will have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to do will be to send me a telegram asking and it will be done.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Mr. Hearst, if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything, you can put the telegram down as a forgery.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",

A new alphabet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem I see with standardized spelling is that the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;English-speaking Peoples&quot; have no language academy to even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attempt to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enforce spelling changes as the language continues to evolve.\n&gt; That is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sort of how we got in this mess (TO) to begin with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I may be abysmally ignorant of the extent of English dialects,\n&gt; but I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suspect that for a very large majority of English speakers,\n&gt; i.e. the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ones clustered in the middle of the bell curve of English\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pronunciation,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we could get along just fine without a standardized spelling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; majority of the words we use on a daily basis are not going to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spelt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so peculiarly by someone from a different, but still one of\n&gt; the major\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speech communities that it would not be recognizable. To be sure,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are the outliers on that bell curve who would need to conform\n&gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speech to a dialect in broader use than their own such as they\n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hear on the BBC or from American news outlets. But for most of\n&gt; us, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doubt we would need spelling police. For example, if I write\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;schedule&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a &quot;k&quot; sound, and a Londoner reads it, I seriously doubt, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have more than a moment&#39;s hesitation in deciphering the word even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; though\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he doesn&#39;t pronounce it that way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If we start insisting that every word must be spelt in accordance\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an arbitrary standard that does not match anyone&#39;s speech\n&gt; completely,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then we will be back to looking up many words and memorizing their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spelling. It is my understanding that in Shakespeare&#39;s time,\n&gt; the idea\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of proper spelling did not exist, and the Bard was quite\n&gt; content to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spell a word one way today and differently tomorrow. That\n&gt; apparently\n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t hold him back We all have been prejudiced by our\n&gt; schooling and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what Kingsley Read called the &quot;cultural fetish&quot; of spelling to\n&gt; reject\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the idea that we can spell words the way we want. If we go too far\n&gt; &gt; &gt; astray, our readers won&#39;t understand, and we pay the price of not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; read. That by itself, forces a high level of conformism onto the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; situation, but to insist that we all have to spell in lockstep\n&gt; or be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; considered morons is quite a different matter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen a number of people insist that we have to have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; standardized\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spelling or we are doomed, but I doubt anyone has actually studied\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so we have no real data as to how an alternative English alphabet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; work if it did or did not use standardized spelling. For\n&gt; example, let\n&gt; &gt; &gt; us assume that we don&#39;t insist on standardized spelling and that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; later found that that decision slowed the average reading speed by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5 or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 10 % (I doubt it would be any greater than that). Would that\n&gt; not be a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reasonable price to pay to avoid putting ourselves back in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; position\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of attempting to memorize how words should be spelt rather than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spelling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them the way they sound in speech? I believe it would,\n&gt; especially for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the dyslexics among us, who cannot deal with arbitrary spellings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If a person occasionally is unsure how to spell a word because he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suspects he may pronounce it differently than others, he could\n&gt; always\n&gt; &gt; &gt; look it up in a dictionary. This is better than trying to memorize\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spelling of virtually his entire vocabulary in order to have it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comply\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with an arbitrary standard of speech.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Paige\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; John Cowan wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; amd64_hacker scripsit:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I&#39;m for abbreviations in all texts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that since QS is meant to be &#39;heard&#39; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t matter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how the word is written but how it is read.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, yes, but that slows down reading to the speed of speech. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suspect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that rapid silent reading and standardized orthography go\n&gt; together --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we do know that fluent readers recognize familiar words by\n&gt; the total\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shape of the word, slowing down only when they must to read an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unfamilar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; word, and that this is equally true in languages that are\n&gt; rationally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spelled, irrationally spelled, or not spelled at all (like\n&gt; Chinese).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So if QS is going to become important for works meant to be read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more than once (as opposed to shorthand/transcription uses), a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standardized orthography will have to evolve.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which immediately leads to the issue of dialects. One&#39;s\n&gt; obvious and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; natural phonetic orthography is another&#39;s stumbling block.\n&gt; (&quot;Hmm,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is it spelled &#39;theft&#39; or &#39;feft&#39;?&quot; &quot;Hmm, does this mean &#39;lord&#39; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;laud&#39;?&quot;) A universal orthography ends up needing to make more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distinctions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than any one dialect actually needs, and thus to some extent\n&gt; becoming\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; artificial to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; John Cowan cowan@... &lt;mailto:cowan%40ccil.org&gt; &lt;mailto:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cowan% &lt;mailto:cowan%25&gt;40ccil.org &lt;http://40ccil.org\n&gt; &lt;http://40ccil.org&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Mr. Lane, if you ever wish anything that I can do, all you\n&gt; will have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to do will be to send me a telegram asking and it will be done.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Mr. Hearst, if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything, you can put the telegram down as a forgery.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"
