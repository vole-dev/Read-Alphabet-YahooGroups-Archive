Quikscript users prefer cursive handwriting and cursive fonts. That doesn&#39;t mean that Quikscript has become a separate script from Shavian: it hasn&#39;t.

That is the structural nature of the script. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Similarly, SHAVIAN FEE doesn&#39;t look like QUIKSCRIPT FEE to me \u2014 nowhere have I seen any QS handwriting where Read has failed to try and loop back rightwards after making the downward stroke.

But for palaeography you choose your preferred font, and a Shavianist chooses his or her preferred font. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I had a look at the Han Unification page on Wikipedia to try and get an idea of what the difference is between glyph variants and different characters, and I couldn&#39;t come up with a clear, crisp distinction \u2014 not surprising given the complicated subject matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, well, I&#39;ve been doing this work for twenty years and the committees don&#39;t rely on rigid definitions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In my own mind, given sets of characters X and Y, where:<br/>\n&gt; - x is some character in X<br/>\n&gt; - y is some character in Y<br/>\n&gt; x is a glyph variant of y\u2026only if x and y are interchangeable <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; KICK and KEY look interchangeable.

If I saw THIGH in a Quickscript text I&#39;d think it were a FEE.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you take it as a question of font and handwriting style, the confusion becomes irrelevant. There are Latin-script handwriting styles which are practically illegible without training -- yet they remain Latin. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is there a general argument in favor of disunification?
