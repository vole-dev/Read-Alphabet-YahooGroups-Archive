But before <br/>\nposting it, I thought it best to explain my intentions, and get your collective <br/>\nfeedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing some frequency work on QS, I was looking at whole stories and essays <br/>\nprinted in existing fonts (Jerome and its variations), and saw in a sudden <br/>\nblinding revelation that the original QS script --- aping, as it does, our Mr. <br/>\nRead&#39;s elegant hand --- was in fact not appropriate for large, printed bodies of <br/>\ntext.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor, even though I love Read for its logical shapes, its grace, and its pleasure <br/>\nin handwriting, I feel now that for an alphabet to prosper, it must be able to <br/>\nmorph itself into alternative fonts that can either whisper or shout, waltz or <br/>\nmarch, wax poetic or prosaic as the need arises. I mean, would anyone read <br/>\nthe Times every morning (or an Agatha Christie every night) if they were <br/>\nprinted in Gothic script or Spencerian penmanship?<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s face it. After almost 40 years before the world, QS has not &quot;taken off&quot; <br/>\nexcept among we happy few. Why is that? Is there something we could learn <br/>\nfrom traditional typography? After all, though our fore-fathers  bollixed up any <br/>\nnatural correspondence of shapes and sounds, they might not have been <br/>\ntotal fools.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I looked at the classic typefaces that we have been employing in Western <br/>\nprinting for the last 200 years, and wondered if their styles and shapes could <br/>\nbe transformed to capture the essence of Mr. Read&#39;s originally-hand-drawn <br/>\ncharacters. And I was amazed to discover that, yes, I think they can.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy new QS font is based upon a font called &quot;Century Schoolbook,&quot; a  face <br/>\nwhich all Americans of a certain age should remember from their first reading <br/>\nlessons: &quot;See Dick run. Run, Dick, run!&quot;  I thought it would make an <br/>\nappropriate &quot;primer&quot; for learning to &quot;read Read.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have just posted a brief &quot;Fish Story&quot; in the Text folder of the Files Section, <br/>\nwhich I would hope you all will have the time and curiosity to peruse. Please <br/>\nlet me know if it &quot;communicates&quot; to you.  If you can, try viewing it at different <br/>\nsizes too - as if you were reading the morning paper, instead of a bronze <br/>\nplaque.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter your feedback, I will post the completed font or - depending on your <br/>\nlearned opinions - just go sulking off into the internet night. It&#39;s up to you all.</div>",
