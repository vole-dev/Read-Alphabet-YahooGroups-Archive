  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1828148377\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a>, Gregory Weidman &lt;delrayva@...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dear Anthony,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m having trouble seeing how to work a strictly phonetic<br/>\n&gt;approach in real life even within my own writing.  My<br/>\n&gt;family and I discussed recently the different<br/>\n&gt;pronunciations  of the &quot;t&quot; in &quot;train&quot; that we have among<br/>\n&gt;us.  The difference is that sometimes TOT is used, and<br/>\n&gt;sometimes CHURCH is used.  Listening to myself carefully<br/>\n&gt;in this and similar words, I find that most of the time<br/>\n&gt;use TOT, but on occasion I will start this word with<br/>\n&gt;CHURCH.  Should I write the exact same word differently<br/>\n&gt;depending on which pronunciation I use in a particular<br/>\n&gt;context?  Certainly not, since I intend the same phoneme<br/>\n&gt;in each context.  Writing this word phonetically just<br/>\n&gt;introduces confusion.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dear Greg,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I do not mean to suggest a purely phonetic implementation of QS but<br/>\nwhat you bring up is very much worth addressing. Indeed I have seen<br/>\ntexts (Aesop&#39;s fables in particular) using Cheer for &quot;tr&quot; through out.<br/>\nThis disturbed me at first. But the only important thing is *I could<br/>\nread it just as well as Tut+Roar* <br/>\n<br/>\n  To get to your observation let me digress into an issue I have that<br/>\nmay help. It&#39;s about vowels but please bear with me. People with my<br/>\naccent do not differentiate between Ox, Ah and Awe. I usually make the<br/>\nsound Ox for all such words but sometimes if I pay close attention to<br/>\nmy own speech I notice that I&#39;ll sometimes say a word with the Ox<br/>\nsound and sometimes the same word has what might pass for an Ah sound.<br/>\nBecause I *mostly* use the Ox sound, I must *just* use Ox otherwise I<br/>\nmight write &quot;tot&quot; sometimes as Tut+On+Tut(which is fine) but sometimes<br/>\nas Tut+Awl+Tut which may sound right to me but would not be for others<br/>\n(eg most British). An especial disaster if I were writing about a tot<br/>\nwho was taught Quickscript.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So to your issue: in a *particular* word, whatever sound &quot;tr&quot; makes<br/>\n*most* of the time indicates the letter a person should use *all* of<br/>\nthe time. Just as you say: a person should spell a given word the same<br/>\nway every time even if on some occasions it sounds slightly different.<br/>\n  But just because a person pronounces one word beginning with &quot;tr&quot; as<br/>\nCheer does not necessarily mean he pronounces every &quot;tr&quot; word that<br/>\nway: it&#39;s important that a particular word be spelled consistently but<br/>\nnot that one slavishly substitute a leading &quot;tr&quot; with the letter Cheer<br/>\nfor every word. So &quot;train&quot; may be Church+Roar+... and &quot;truck&quot;<br/>\nTut+Roar+... but they both have to stay that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So I suggest QS is not in fact a literal phonetic transcription of<br/>\nactual speech but that a word&#39;s spelling is determined by its<br/>\nidealized pronunciation in the speakers accent. It is this<br/>\n&quot;semi-phonetic&quot; nature of the script that is causing so much<br/>\ndiscussion but I argue this is 1. how it is in practice used and 2.<br/>\nwhat Read meant (in much of the book anyway) and 3. the only workable<br/>\nway to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Other consonant problems are one of emphasis.  When I<br/>\n&gt;want to emphasize the word &quot;Matter,&quot; I will use TOT in the<br/>\n&gt;middle of it.  When I am not emphasizing the word, I use<br/>\n&gt;&quot;DEAD&quot; in the middle of it.  Should I spell the same word<br/>\n&gt;differently depending on whether I am emphasizing it?  I<br/>\n&gt;hardly think so.  (Just as a note -- I use DEAD in the<br/>\n&gt;middle of &quot;Matters&quot; almost exclusively, even when<br/>\n&gt;emphasizing it.)  In each case, the same phoneme is<br/>\n&gt;communicated, even if they are phonetically distinct.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Intentionally varying spelling for emphasis is an intriguing idea. It<br/>\nmaybe a valid literary technique just as writing in dialect is (or was<br/>\nanyway). If so, it is a literary tool authors would have in<br/>\nQuickscript that they do not in Traditional Orthodoxy. It&#39;s really<br/>\nsomething to think about and not automatically rule out. Building a<br/>\nnew system allows one potentially to break free of old restrictions if<br/>\nthey have no value and what you point out as a problem would also<br/>\nallow a conveyance of information (in this case emotional content)<br/>\nthat is impossible in TO. In that it would be quite valuable and<br/>\nreally worth considering.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As an aside, has anyone else noticed that Read uses THITHER instead<br/>\n&gt; of THOTH in the words &quot;with&quot; and &quot;without&quot; on page 11 of QM?  Is this<br/>\n&gt; really the way he pronounced these words?  I can&#39;t even get my mouth<br/>\n&gt;to form that sound in the middle of &quot;without.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   It is indeed how he pronounced &quot;with&quot;<br/>\n   You&#39;ll find that RP has wild differences from American English<br/>\nwhich is what makes my comparison of a story written in each accent so<br/>\ncompelling when they turn out spelled virtually identically.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see how Kingsley pronounced any given word in the Cambridge<br/>\ndictionary as Oxford-Cambridge is the high guardian of Received<br/>\nPronunciation English (called RP).<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dictionary.cambridge.org/\">http://www.dictionary.cambridge.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, if some sort of phonetic or phonemic spelling is *not*<br/>\nused, be prepared to QS spell the way that dictionary pronounces<br/>\nthings. In particular, you and I are going to have to use THITHER in a<br/>\nlot of words we don&#39;t want to because spelling is going to be fixed to<br/>\nthe way Kingsley did it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Of course, that might explain why he needed an<br/>\n&gt;abbreviation for &quot;with&quot; when WOW-IT-THOTH is so easy to<br/>\n&gt;write.  I don&#39;t think this observation helps my argument<br/>\n&gt;at all, but it is an interesting point to consider as we<br/>\n&gt;discuss this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You hit a good point and it turns out to be quite relevant to your<br/>\n&quot;tr&quot; issue. Kingsley also insists we spell &quot;the&quot; with a lone THITHER<br/>\nbecause if we did not we would have to change that last vowel from<br/>\nUTTER to EAT all the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nForgive me as you already probably know all this but here are some<br/>\nuseful links: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_pair\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_pair</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\n-Tony</div>",
