I read two of the articles in the \nNews in QS with interest today, and I have been reading what others are \nwriting by hand in QS without problems in recent weeks.  I write it \nfluently just as Moira mentioned she does.  The problem is not with QS \nbut with the amount of practice that we receive.  I just cannot read QS \nas fast as TO, which is not surprising when you consider that we are \nsurrounded by TO all the time and that we learned it as children. I \ndaresay that if as a child you had been told how TO worked, but were \ngiven no reading practice in it, no one around you used it, and you \nnever received anything written in it, you would be just as slow at \nreading TO as you are now at reading QS.\n\nI would like to attain the reading speed in QS that I have in TO.  That \ngoal is still some distance away, but it is getting closer.  For the \nfirst time, with the ability to communicate effectively in QS and to \nread articles, news, etc. written in it, I have no question that goal \ncan be attained.  I can already see that my QS reading speed has been \nincreasing in recent weeks.  And even now, I&#39;m not reading QS every day.\n\nJust as a beginning TO reader sounds words out, we have to do that in QS \nuntil we begin to automatically recognize word outlines.  Until recently \nthat has not been feasible because there are too few of us, and we tend \nto only read what we write ourselves.  For instance, I take notes in QS \nas secretary of a club I&#39;m in.  I then go back and transliterate them on \nthe computer for the club records.  Thus, my reading speed isn&#39;t \ncritical and QS is still useful. \n\nA fluent reader recognizes words at sight and doesn&#39;t have to break them \ndown into individual syllables or letters.  However, in reading your \nnews today, I saw numerous words in QS for the first time.  The shorter, \ncommon words I read quickly and essentially automatically just as I do \nin TO.  But three, four and five syllable words that are unfamiliar are \na different matter.  Here are a few words I remember reading in QS for \nthe first time today, and there are countless others: Islamabad, Islamic \nmilitants, Afghanistan, Land Cruiser, bullet-proofed (this last one \nhasn&#39;t come up much in my personal note-taking.)   :-).\n\nSince the term &quot;Islamic militants&quot; was in the Pakistan story several \ntimes, it began looking familiar by the end of the story, but that is \nwhat has to occur to build up reading speed.\n\n\nPaige\n\nP.S.  Here is an example of the pressure we face against using QS.  A \nfew years ago, I was taking notes in QS in a case.  Later my father, \nwith whom I practiced, would be looking at a file, and tell me that I \nneeded to write in TO.  His customary comment was, &quot;What if you get hit \nby a bus, and I have to take this case over.  I won&#39;t be able to read \nyour notes.&quot;  The same problem exists when my secretary is working on a \ndocument and has to refer to the file.  If there are notes in QS, I have \nto rewrite them for her, which isn&#39;t exactly a time-saver.\n\nWhat would be interesting would be for someone to teach their child to \nread QS before they go to school and see how easily they take to it.\n\n\n\nPaul Tremblay wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Paige Gabhart wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Paul:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let me add my superlatives to the others.
