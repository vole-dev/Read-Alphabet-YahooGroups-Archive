I started the Read_Alphabet group\nafter having used QS for 25+ years because I felt those of us who favor\nQS over Shavian needed a forum to develop the QS resources available on\nthe net.  Unfortnately, I have so many demands on my time, that I have\nnot been able to devote the time to the group that I would like to.\n\nWe still need an improved version of Jerome (font) to communicate in.\nJon Zuck did a great job getting us started, but Jerome still has some\nproblems that need to be addressed\n\nI am using a hybrid Linux/Windows OS, and have not worked out how to use\nJerome or a version thereof on my Linux box yet, which in the past few\nmonths has kept me from sending messages on the site using QS.\n\nEwout introduced us to the use of a program called Keyman to let us\nremap our keyboards to type QS, including its half-letters.  I prepared\na key mapping, based upon Jon Zuck&#39;s and my own ideas, which is\npredicated upon some of the traditional roman alphabet orthography.\nThis  makes typing in QS much easier than the desparately unintuitive\nmapping the Shavian group uses.   I sent a couple of e-mails about this\nback in late winter or early spring but received no feedback so I have\nno idea if anyone in the group besides myself is using this presently.\n\nGood to hear from you again.\n\nPaige Gabhart\n\nandy_callaway wrote:\n\n&gt;  I&#39;ve just joined this group.
