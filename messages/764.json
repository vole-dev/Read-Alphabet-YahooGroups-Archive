Do you think I went overboard with &#39;culture&#39; in the last  \nsentence?\n\nUsing this method, it may be possible to make an almost-senior  \nversion of the same font.  In fact, if I can figure out the  \n&#39;alternate glyphs&#39; thing then I might be able to shoehorn half  \ncharacters in as well.\n\nYou may notice that the above text is from the QS manual.  My reason  \nfor doing this, in fact, is because I am attempting to convert the QS  \nmanual so that it might be displayed on the web, using (downloadable)  \nunicode fonts.  The Kingsley font (and jerome too) is a close match  \nfor the writing in the manual, but when used to write more than a  \nsingle word it just looked bad: now it looks much better, and with  \nUnicode it is very easy to intermix quickscript and orthodox.  I will  \ntry uploading an in-progress PDF later today, if I am able to verify  \nthat it displays correctly on a machine without the font installed  \n(the font is not ready for prime time, and I&#39;d rather sit on it than  \nhave lots of different versions out there).\n\noliver\n\n\r\n--Apple-Mail-13-381197372--\r\n\n"
