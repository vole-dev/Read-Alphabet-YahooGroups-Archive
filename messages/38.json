  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1360876426\">I have taught english in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. The first language is English and the students are learning it when young.  Moreover, they use British or American dictionaries and are accustomed  to the IPA from elementary school.  Also, they are use to using roman letters since this alphabet is internationally used to teach English at an early age.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDue to the large number of people who do translation work in a number ofcountries, Esperanto will be resisted.  Moreover, it threatens national languages since people would tend  to speak Esperanto rather than their own language.  For example, in the U.S. there are a number of people from other countries so most people would speak Esperanto on the street rather than their own language.  Eventually advertising and commerce would use Esperanto.  Once  textbooks are written in Esperanto then the discussions would be in Esperanto.  People who like their own language would become as belligerent as they are in Canada about French and English.  Culture, religion, and everything else is involved in a national language.  So, it is natural to resist an international language unless you are a cosmopolite and there are not so many of those compared to nationalists right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSid   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Good to hear from you.&nbsp; You wrote me a letter in quikscript several<br/>\n&gt; months, and I have been a poor correspondent, in that I have not found<br/>\n&gt; time to write back.&nbsp; I will correct that as soon as I can.&nbsp; I<br/>\n&gt; also received a quikscript letter from Jon Zuck so I will try to write<br/>\n&gt; both of you back at the same time.&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 09:36 PM 2/17/01 +0000, you wrote:&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;blockquote type=cite class=cite cite&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Many years ago I&nbsp; taught<br/>\n&gt; the Shaw&#39;s alphabet to Japanese English students.

Your students already<br/>\n&gt; had a tool sufficient for their purposes (IPA) so it does not surprise me<br/>\n&gt; they expressed the very human reluctance to learning something they<br/>\n&gt; undoubtedly viewed as superfluous.&nbsp; However, I would not anticipate<br/>\n&gt; that most foreign students interested in learning English would already<br/>\n&gt; know the IPA so your experience, I posit, is not typical of the majority<br/>\n&gt;

language.&nbsp; A mild reform of the international phonetic script would<br/>\n&gt; probably be more easier for foreign students.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think the preceding has as an underlying assumption that the roman<br/>\n&gt; alphabet is more widely known than it really is.&nbsp; I cannot believe<br/>\n&gt; the symbols used in quikscript are more difficult to learn than the roman<br/>\n&gt; alphabet.&nbsp; First, there is no lower and upper case to be bothered<br/>\n&gt; with.&nbsp; Secondly, the symbols are actually simpler than the roman<br/>\n&gt; alphabet.&nbsp; That alphabet, however, is so ubiquitous in the western<br/>\n&gt; world that those of us who use it do so constantly, with the result that<br/>\n&gt; we are probably poor judges in gauging its ease of learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>\n&gt; If we take the world as a whole, including Asia, India and the middle<br/>\n&gt; east, obviously significant portions of mankind use alphabets with<br/>\n&gt; absolutely no relationship (or a very distant relationship) to the roman<br/>\n&gt; alphabet.&nbsp; Those people would have to learn a new alphabet in any<br/>\n&gt; event.&nbsp; Why shouldn&#39;t they learn an alphabet that effectively deals<br/>\n&gt; with the phonemes of English, even if, at this time, it were just to be<br/>\n&gt; considered a teaching alphabet.&nbsp; I suspect many immigrants to the<br/>\n&gt; U.S. become more or less fluent in English by learning English from the<br/>\n&gt; speech of those around them.&nbsp; I think it is common that many of<br/>\n&gt; these people make little progress in learning to read and write English,<br/>\n&gt; and the blame for that can be laid at the door of the roman<br/>\n&gt; alphabet.&nbsp; I recently had a client from Mexico, who has been in the<br/>\n&gt; U.S. for about twelve years.&nbsp; His English is strongly accented, but<br/>\n&gt; understandable.&nbsp; However, the man has absolutely no confidence he<br/>\n&gt; can spell anything &quot;correctly&quot; in English.&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;blockquote type=cite class=cite cite&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Someone mentioned<br/>\n&gt; Esperanto.&nbsp; I am fluent in that language.&nbsp; The reason it is not<br/>\n&gt; accepted is that nationalists feel it a threat to their own<br/>\n&gt; language.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I won&#39;t disagree with that.&nbsp; However, I would also suggest that it<br/>\n&gt; suffers from the same bootstrap problem that Shavian or Quikscript<br/>\n&gt; suffers from.&nbsp; When I studied Esperanto myself, its logic and<br/>\n&gt; simplicity appealed to me.&nbsp; After awhile I found myself thinking<br/>\n&gt; that if and when I became fluent in it, I would be able to speak to,<br/>\n&gt; perhaps, a million or two million (maybe even the ten million its<br/>\n&gt; adherents claim) people in the world.&nbsp; But if I learn Spanish, for<br/>\n&gt; example, most of South America is opened to me with hundreds of millions<br/>\n&gt; of people I could communicate with.&nbsp; Which has more<br/>\n&gt; practicality?&nbsp; Other than on this website or the Shavian site, I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know that I have ever come into contact with anyone fluent in<br/>\n&gt; Esperanto.&nbsp; You certainly don&#39;t need it in the U.S.&nbsp; But every<br/>\n&gt; English speaker could benefit from Quikscript.&nbsp; (those who know the<br/>\n&gt; roman alphabet would reap the time benefit from using Q.S.&nbsp; Those<br/>\n&gt; learning English would benefit even more.)&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The situation brings to mind how difficult it must have been to sell the<br/>\n&gt; first few telephones in a town.&nbsp; Who would want one when there was<br/>\n&gt; no one else to call?&nbsp; Of course, you didn&#39;t have to study to learn<br/>\n&gt; to use a telephone so the bootstrap problem was much less severe for<br/>\n&gt; Bell.&nbsp; For Quikscript to grow, we have to show the public that it<br/>\n&gt; can be useful in their lives immediately.&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;blockquote type=cite class=cite cite&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Secondly, there are a number of<br/>\n&gt; countries in which people can&#39;t even read and write their own<br/>\n&gt; language.&nbsp; &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Obviously, countries with high illiteracy rates are not going to attempt<br/>\n&gt; to teach their citizens Esperanto before they learn to read and write<br/>\n&gt; their own language, but I am not sure what that has to do with the<br/>\n&gt; adoption of Esperanto as a second language for many people around the<br/>\n&gt; world.&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;blockquote type=cite class=cite cite&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Thirdly, the governments of the<br/>\n&gt; world would have to agree to this language and yet the supersigns of<br/>\n&gt; Esperanto I believe have deterred it from being<br/>\n&gt; international.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am not sure about this.&nbsp; Many languages use supersigns.&nbsp;<br/>\n&gt; French, Spanish and German do.&nbsp; The age of the typewriter is about<br/>\n&gt; dead, but obviously, typewriters in use in the countries where the<br/>\n&gt; preceding languages are spoken had keys for those supersigns.&nbsp;<br/>\n&gt; Although I have no experience with this, I can only assume that a<br/>\n&gt; Frenchman does not have to go to a lot of trouble to place supersigns<br/>\n&gt; over what he writes.&nbsp; By the way, the League of Nations, I believe,<br/>\n&gt; had agreed for Esperanto to be one of its official languages, but it was<br/>\n&gt; too short-lived for anything to come of it.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the U.N<br/>\n&gt; spends millions every year translating everything they do into multiple<br/>\n&gt; languages.&nbsp; I have read the new European Union is even worse -- they<br/>\n&gt; translate everything into even more languages than the U.N. does.&nbsp;<br/>\n&gt; Insanity!&nbsp; Diplomats and bureaucrats could learn Esperanto easily,<br/>\n&gt; and it would make perfect sense for them.&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Paige&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;!-- |**|begin egp html banner|**| --&gt;<br/>\n&gt;

translate everything into even more languages than the U.N. does.&nbsp;\n&gt; Insanity!&nbsp; Diplomats and bureaucrats could learn Esperanto easily,\n&gt; and it would make perfect sense for them.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;
