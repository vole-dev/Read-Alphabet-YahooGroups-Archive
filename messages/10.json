My thoughts are as follows:  no doubt some may<br/>\nconsider them a convenience, but they mimic the Roman alphabet, <br/>\nwhich, as Shaw wrote, should not be part of the new<br/>\nalphabet.  If we are to depart from the framework of one letter for <br/>\neach sound to one letter for two sounds, then why stop with<br/>\nthe X forms?  It might be handy to have a letter for &quot;br,&quot; or &quot;st&quot; or <br/>\nany other digraph you can think of.  My objection is that it is<br/>\npatently an attempt to respond to a perceived benefit of the Roman <br/>\nalphabet.

You&#39;re responding to these word-shapes like I do.  Fearing not <br/>\nto plunge ahead where I know virtually nothing about what<br/>\nis involved, let me ask: is it possible to include a half-space in <br/>\nthe font (or whatever would be needed -- a negative half-space?)<br/>\nto align the cursor properly again after a Win-Win is used?  In this <br/>\nmanner, after the writer uses a Win-Win, when he spaces at<br/>\nthe end of the word, he adds the half-space to realign the cursor <br/>\nproperly.  (I hope this does not sound as uninformed as I fear it<br/>\ndoes.)  If there is no way to correct the offset, then people <br/>\nprobably just will not use the half-Win-Win that much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;6.

A half-Whitewheat is angled from <br/>\nleft to right (as written), and its barb is to the left,<br/>\nwhereas, a half-Deed is vertical and has its barb to the right.
