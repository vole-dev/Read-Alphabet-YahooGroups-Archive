Other languages have solved<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (or never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; encountered) the problem of descenders by simply<br/>\n&gt; &gt; making one square<br/>\n&gt; &gt; writing line (Chinese, Japanese, Korean for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instance).  I would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; suggest the same to you.  Once again, I would argue<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that most people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do not really make the IPA distinctions (in this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; case between voiced<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and unvoiced).  HowEVER, people ARE able to think of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a relation<br/>\n&gt; &gt; between sounds, so your scheme of inversing letters<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to denote<br/>\n&gt; &gt; voiced/unvoiced pairs is still a good one and will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; help in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; memorization.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you still wish to retain some immediately<br/>\n&gt; &gt; definining character<br/>\n&gt; &gt; between voiced and unvoiced, perhaps a little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tweaking is in order?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe make all unvoiced characters start in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lower right quadrant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and all voiced ones in the upper right?  Those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exceptions to pairs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could start anywhere else.  These are of course just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; random ideas to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; let you know directions you could take.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I personally think it would be fine without such<br/>\n&gt; &gt; distinctions aside<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from the inverting.  When creating a new alphabet,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is often easy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to err on the side of either mnemonics, readability<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or writing speed,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whilst throwing one or both of the others out of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; balance.

This is not to say that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Quickscript needs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to be changed.  Far from it.  In fact, I still love<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it.

Keep<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in mind that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most alphabet learning is done by straight<br/>\n&gt; &gt; memorization anyway and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has been for millenia.
