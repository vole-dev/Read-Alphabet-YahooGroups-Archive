Others <br/>\nargue against such rules because it means memorizing words by rote, a <br/>\npractice that makes QS as bad as TO, but I don&#39;t think so. We are <br/>\ntalking about a small number of words for each dialect.

So I argue that having QS may not be able to be constructed so <br/>\nthat everyone can write exactly as they hear words. For the most part, <br/>\nusers should be able to write QS this way, but their will be cases when <br/>\nthey cannot. Since Read has prescribed that It be used for &quot;y&quot; at the <br/>\nend of a word, and since he states that the letter &quot;r&quot; should always be <br/>\nwritten, QS has already developed some conventions of its own.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the chart at hand. I agree with your proposal in the other <br/>\nthread that we should use Awl Roar for those who merge words like <br/>\n&quot;North&quot; and &quot;Force.&quot; This is the convention already, and I see no reason <br/>\nto change it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am surprised at the small number of objections you have raised about <br/>\nmy chart.
