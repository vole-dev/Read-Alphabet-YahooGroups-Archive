If you have answers for me, I&#39;d be glad to put them together as an FAQ to publish on the group page.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. is thee a computer-typed (OCR&#39;d) version of the original Quickscript manual? I mean something that&#39;s easier to read than the scanned typewriter paper.<br/>\n(If there isn&#39;t and somebody would OCR it, I&#39;d be glad to help edit it to a nice HTML and PDF version.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. the manual offers a short word-list to start learning writing and instructs the reader to make up his own word list as they go. Now, I am German and I don&#39;t know the pronunciation of many words (and others I pronounce wrong). I am planning to learn Quickscript and learn some good acceptable English pronunciation on the way. (Don&#39;t mind which one.) Are there any word lists for this?<br/>\nI think Quickscript is great for foreigners to learn English! So it would be good to have some material.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. is it possible to write in this forum in Quickscript? if yes, how? if no, what would be necessary to do it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s it for now!<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks in advance,<br/>\nRobert</div>",
