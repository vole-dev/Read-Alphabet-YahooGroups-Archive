I&#39;ll give it <br/>\n99%!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would certainly distinguish between #33AWE and #34Ox and between <br/>\n#29EIGHt and #30At.  Yes, although the IPA differs from the BBC <br/>\nchart, the assignment of lexical sets is much the same.  So when I <br/>\npicked up the QS manual a few weeks ago, there were few letters that <br/>\nbothered me.  Use of #29EIGHt-#25Roe for the SQUARE set was the main <br/>\none. Your proposal of #28Et-#25Roe is spot-on.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne suggestion: for NEAR, I&#39;d keep #26It-#25Roe as the first <br/>\ntranscription, but #27EAt-#25Roe as an alternative - as you&#39;ve done <br/>\non the American chart. I hear both on the street - and on TV shows <br/>\nwhere Australian accents are exaggerated for comic effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one warning.

Since I&#39;m new to QS, I&#39;m still reading quite <br/>\nslowly, and the American spellings sometimes make me blink, then <br/>\nsmile.  Particularly cases where #3Tea is dropped.
