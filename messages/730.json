The usefulness of having  \nQuickscript in Unicode would be mixed-mode documents combining latin  \ncharacters with quickscript and other alternative writing systems.  A  \nseparate encoding would enable such tools as Quickscript spell- \nchecking and dictionaries to live alongside with traditional English  \northography.  I also think that it would enable some more exploration  \nwith Quickscript fonts than has been tried so far: fonts with  \ncombining glyphs to emulate the flowing nature of senior Quickscript.\n\nThese are all benefits that the Quickscript community (us) would  \nreceive from QS being part of the Unicode standard.  What would be  \nthe advantage to the Unicode consortium, or at least other parties?   \nAt a basic level, we would have to assume an interest in English  \nspelling reformation, or at least in alternate writing systems.  This  \nis consistent with scripts such as Bopomofo for Mandarin and Shavian  \nfor English already being included in the Unicode standard.  I would  \nargue that Quickscript is at least historically significant in the  \nliterature for spelling reformation; and I think that the people in  \nthis group are interested in spreading its use more widely.  (I see  \nthat the Quickscript Yahoo group &quot;Read_Alphabet&quot; is in fact much  \nlarger--though quieter--than the Shavian group &quot;shawalphabet&quot;: 298  \nvs. 82 members.)\n\nOne argument against Quickscript would be the lack of any formal  \npublished works using it.  There is no Androcles and the Lion in  \nQuickscript.  However, I think this is something that can and will be  \naddressed in the future.  The task of translating existing documents  \nis getting easier, especially with increasing access electronic  \npublic domain texts and machine-translation tools such as the perl  \nscripts that amd64_hacker recently posted.  Moreover, there are  \nalready some attempts at creating a mixed TO and Quickscript lesson  \nbook in the files section of this site: Unicode would help this  \nproject immensely and it in turn would help spread the knowledge (and  \nperhaps usage as well) of Quickscript!\n\nThe most important reason for me personally is that I think  \nQuickscript (or any alternative writing system) must be machine  \nreadable if it is to be useful going into the future.  Computers are  \nhow we store and process almost all information now.  Though it was  \ndesigned to be easy to write by hand, I think Quickscript also  \npresents other benefits over  Latin-alphabet English and even Shavian  \nspelling: conciseness (in its abbreviated words), clarity (in its  \nsound-based approach), and readability (with related letters more  \ndifferentiated than in Shavian).\n\noliver\n\n\r\n--Apple-Mail-4--303863304\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=ISO-8859-1\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;word-wrap: break-word;
