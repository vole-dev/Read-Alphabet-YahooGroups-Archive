Your mention <br/>\nof this reminded me of my own experience with a QS pen pal in Lower <br/>\nHutt, New Zealand, and I have just reached into my desk drawer and <br/>\npulled out a letter written to me on 6 February 1976 by Harold <br/>\nTrembath.  Harold had a lovely QS hand - very neat and precisely written <br/>\n- just what you would expect from a retired accountant.  Only an <br/>\noccasional letter or pronunciation would give me pause.  I found it <br/>\nrefreshing that some of his accent came through in his writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this would work today since people are so <br/>\ncomputer-oriented, but reading other people&#39;s handwritten QS is very <br/>\ngood practice in my opinion.  Sir James Pitman mentioned <br/>\n&quot;ever-circulators&quot; or something to that effect in the prologue to <br/>\n/Androcles and the Lion/.  I believe this term refers to a letter which <br/>\nis sent round to a number of people, with each person adding to the text <br/>\nof the letter.  In that manner, each person has a chance to read what <br/>\neveryone else in the group has written and a chance to practice <br/>\nthemselves.  There is no reason something like this could not be done <br/>\ntoday for reading and writing practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anyone in the group who would like to participate in such a <br/>\nproject?  You just have to promise to send the letter on its rounds and <br/>\nnot hold it too long in making your contribution to it.  The topic of <br/>\nthe letter could be QS and ways to promote it, or anything else that <br/>\nsuits the participants.
