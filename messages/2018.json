But as I&#39;ve encountered ambiguity<br/>\nafter ambiguity in my own note-taking, simply in the attempt to record<br/>\nmy own personal pronunciation, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that QS<br/>\nshould be considered an alternative spelling system which must be<br/>\nlearned. And thus it makes sense to learn an international system. It<br/>\ngoes without saying that such a system would be far easier to learn<br/>\nthan the present system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe proposal below is excellent. The task of putting together the<br/>\nclues in the Quickscript Manual, though, requires the perspective of a<br/>\ndeeper understanding of different accents of English than most people<br/>\nhave. What is needed is a new manual, with some discussion of the<br/>\nWells lexical sets and numerous examples of the use of an<br/>\ninternational QS.

(eg: the caught/cot merger in General American).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s just something Americans (actually, only about 50% of them)<br/>\n&gt; will have to learn, just as most anglophones will have to learn when to<br/>\n&gt; write 18 Way and when to write 20 Why, because they no longer distinguish<br/>\n&gt; them in speech. (The distinction is still robust in Scotland, Ireland,<br/>\n&gt; and the American South.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I think most would agree that RP could be used as a standard for UK<br/>\n&gt;&gt; English, cause most Britians know what it sounds like and can imagine<br/>\n&gt;&gt; how to write it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s about the best we can do. QS is definitely problematic when<br/>\n&gt; compared to Orthodox for many U.K. accents, because it merges away<br/>\n&gt; distinctions that are vital to them, like the Scottish English distinction<br/>\n&gt; between &quot;fern&quot;, &quot;fir&quot;, and &quot;fur&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I do support the idea that a true international quickscript should<br/>\n&gt;&gt; include the rhotic &#39;r&#39; though it is a little difficult for us non-<br/>\n&gt;&gt; rhotic speakers to know where to put them but not overly so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of the 24 Wells lexical sets for stressed vowels, we can immediately<br/>\n&gt; assign the 15 non-rhotic ones as follows:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; KIT = 26 It<br/>\n&gt; FLEECE = 27 Eat<br/>\n&gt; DRESS = 28 Et<br/>\n&gt; FACE = 29 Eight<br/>\n&gt; TRAP = 30 At<br/>\n&gt; PRICE = 31 I<br/>\n&gt; PALM = 32 Ah<br/>\n&gt; THOUGHT = 33 Awe<br/>\n&gt; LOT = 34 Ox<br/>\n&gt; CHOICE = 35 Oy<br/>\n&gt; STRUT = 36 Utter<br/>\n&gt; MOUTH = 37 Out<br/>\n&gt; GOAT = 38 Owe<br/>\n&gt; FOOT = 39 Foot<br/>\n&gt; GOOSE = 40 Ooze<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thus, for example, Americans outside Eastern New England will need to<br/>\n&gt; learn to distinguish LOT words from PALM words, writing the former with<br/>\n&gt; 34 Ox and the latter with 32 Ah. By the same token, New Zealanders<br/>\n&gt; will need to learn to distinguish KIT words from STRUT words, writing<br/>\n&gt; the former with 26 It and the latter with 36 Utter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of the 7 rhotics, The Manual tells us these either explicitly or by<br/>\n&gt; example:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; NURSE = 36 Utter + 25 Roe<br/>\n&gt; START = 32 Ah + 25 Roe<br/>\n&gt; SQUARE = 29 Eight + 25 Roe<br/>\n&gt; NEAR = 27 Eat + 25 Roe<br/>\n&gt; FORCE = 33 Awe + 25 Roe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not clear what to do with the CURE and NORTH lexical sets. In RP<br/>\n&gt; all three sound the same, although the change of CURE was probably not<br/>\n&gt; yet standard in Reid&#39;s day. For the sake of American understanding,<br/>\n&gt; probably the best choice is:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; CURE = 40 Ooze + 25 Roe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Most accents have merged the NORTH set (which is pretty small) into<br/>\n&gt; FORCE, so that &quot;horse&quot; (NORTH) and &quot;hoarse&quot; (FORCE) sound the same.<br/>\n&gt; Making everyone learn this distinction for the sake of those in Scotland,<br/>\n&gt; Ireland, Eastern New England, and the Caribbean who have it seems like<br/>\n&gt; overkill, but we could allow an alternative here:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; NORTH = 33 Awe + 25 Roe (most speakers)<br/>\n&gt; NORTH = 38 Owe + 25 Roe (those speakers who distinguish)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The two remaining stressed-vowel lexical sets, BATH and CLOTH, are never<br/>\n&gt; pronounced distinctly from any other set, so they don&#39;t need their own<br/>\n&gt; letters. Most Americans outside Eastern New England, and most non-RP<br/>\n&gt; speakers in the U.K., pronounce the BATH words like the TRAP set; most<br/>\n&gt; others like the PALM set. Since the set of BATH words is smaller in<br/>\n&gt; Australia than in RP, I propose adhering to Orthodox here and writing:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BATH = 30 At<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Similarly, most North Americans pronounce the CLOTH set like the THOUGHT<br/>\n&gt; set, most other anglophones pronounce it like the LOT set. So again<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d use Orthodox as the tie-breaker and write:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; CLOTH = 34 Ox<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lastly, the four unstressed sets have spellings prescribed in The Manual:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; happY = 26 It<br/>\n&gt; commA = 36 Utter<br/>\n&gt; lettER = 36 Utter + 25 Roe<br/>\n&gt; intO = 40 Ooze<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s possible that the use of 26 It rather than 27 Eat for happY should<br/>\n&gt; be reconsidered, as almost all speakers have shifted to it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John Cowan <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cowan@...\">cowan@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ccil.org/~cowan\">http://www.ccil.org/~cowan</a><br/>\n&gt; Humpty Dump Dublin squeaks through his norse<br/>\n&gt; Humpty Dump Dublin hath a horrible vorse<br/>\n&gt; But for all his kinks English / And his irismanx brogues<br/>\n&gt; Humpty Dump Dublin&#39;s grandada of all rogues. --Cousin James<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
