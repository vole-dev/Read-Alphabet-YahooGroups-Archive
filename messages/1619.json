Now, which should be which? I suggest assigning<br>\n&gt; &#39;original utter&#39; to /V/ and &#39;alternative utter&#39; to /@/.<br>\n&gt; <br>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to keep &#39;original utter&#39; for the stressed vowel because it&#39;s<br>\n&gt; the primary form in the original alphabet. The alternative was only<br>\n&gt; introduced in the QM for convenience in connecting to subsequent<br>\n&gt; letters, and the only one of these that I&#39;ve included in preliminary<br>\n&gt; sketches for my font is #36+#24 (which I call &#39;Ultra&#39;).<br>\n&gt; <br>\n&gt; Under this proposal, I don&#39;t see any way to avoid promoting the symbol<br>\n&gt; for &#39;alternative utter&#39; to full membership in the alphabet. For now<br>\n&gt; I&#39;m calling it #36 1/2, with the idea that the most natural thing to<br>\n&gt; do is to put it immediately after #36 and bump the remaining letters<br>\n&gt; over one position. I&#39;d also like to swap Jon Zuck&#39;s names, calling #36<br>\n&gt; &#39;Up&#39; and #36 1/2 &#39;Ado&#39; to reflect stress.<br>\n&gt; <br>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s best to continue to use &#39;original utter&#39; in the ligature<br>\n&gt; of #36+#25. This does lead naturally to the question (already under<br>\n&gt; discussion) of whether this ligature should be considered a letter in<br>\n&gt; it&#39;s own right. That question is complicated by the fact that there<br>\n&gt; are other ligatures such as #33+#25 which would also be candidates for<br>\n&gt; letter-hood. This is a bit of a quandry since it seems to me that the<br>\n&gt; larger the alphabet, the more intimidating it is for beginners.<br>\n&gt; <br>\n&gt; I&#39;ve updated this document to reflect these ideas:<br>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://staff.washington.edu/freeman/qs/qs_proposal2.pdf\">http://staff.washington.edu/freeman/qs/qs_proposal2.pdf</a> <br>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://staff.washington.edu/freeman/qs/qs_proposal2.pdf\">http://staff.washington.edu/freeman/qs/qs_proposal2.pdf</a>&gt;<br>\n&gt; <br>\n&gt; (Comments on the choices of ligatures to include in a new font, and<br>\n&gt; their names and keyboard assignments are welcome!)<br>\n&gt; <br>\n<br></span></div>\nHi Ted,<br>\n<br>\nFirst off, I like your chart. I like the way you number the additions <br>\nsuch as Loch.<br>\n<br>\nIf we are trying to make the alphabet smaller, then we might consider <br>\ngetting rid of both Loch and LLan. If I am correct, these letters are <br>\nmeant to express sounds in Scotish and Irish English, but our new <br>\nconcept of lexical sets no longer thinks of the Read alphabet as a <br>\nphonetic alphabet. I believe other letters will serve for these two. If <br>\nwe give Scotts their own letter, why shouldn&#39;t we give Australian 4 or 5 <br>\nof their own letters, since many of their vowels correspond to any Read <br>\nletter? This is just a suggestion. I&#39;m not really attached to this <br>\nposition, but only bring it up because we are concerned about making the <br>\nalphabet too big and really an alternative Ado might serve us better.<br>\n<br>\nI know there was reason that Read got rid of the two forms of Utter in <br>\nhis original alphabet. I think the reason was that no one could <br>\ndistinguish between the two? I know that I would have a hard time in <br>\nmany cases. However, I think you are suggesting that we use the <br>\nalternate form of Ado discriminately, only before Roar, for example?<br>\n<br>\nI also like the ligature Error and I think I&#39;ll include that in my font. <br>\n  Regarding which ligatures to include, that is something I have also <br>\nthought about. If we include Earth, why not the others? Reading the news <br>\ntoday in occurred to me that there are other words which contain two <br>\nvowels followed by Roar, but these combinations did not confuse me. I <br>\nguess it comes down to how confusing ceratain combinations are. As I get <br>\nmore experienced reading QS, will I be able to sort out Ado Roar Ed with <br>\nthe same ease I sort out other letters? I can&#39;t tell at this point.<br>\n<br>\nPaul<br>\n<p></p>\n    </div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-428368658q\">  \n\n    \n    <span style=\"color:white;\"></span>\n\n</span></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><br><br clear=\"all\"><br>-- <br>Check out Ziphen Central!<br>Weekly posts on interesting and unique topics.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ziphen.benjaminbruce.com\">http://ziphen.benjaminbruce.com</a>\n</div>",
