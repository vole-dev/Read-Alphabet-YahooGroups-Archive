The range of sounds recognized as a particular word\nvaries from word to word. \n\nOne locates phonemes by finding at least one minimal pair.  A pair of words\nwhich will change meaning if one feature is allowed to\nvary: e.g. The existance of pit/pet means that the short i and short e are\nboth English phonemes.\n\nIf one dictionary pronunciation guide will not work for two dialects of\nEnglish, then there may also be problems with a phonemic notation. Pitman\nargued that his i/t/a notation was not a pronunciation guide since each\nlocale determined what constituted an ey sound.\n\nAn Australian probably has no difficulty distinguishing DAY and DIE but an\nAmerican might confuse the two &quot;strine pronunciations.\n\n\n\n--- &quot;Joe&quot; &lt;allegrox_2000@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Read did set standards for certain prefixes and suffixes, fully\nexpecting standards to develop for others.  (His can be found in the\nQuikscript Manual, by the way.) \n\nSB: I presume the manual is in the file section.\n\nThe solution that&#39;s been proposed for Shavian is to define the sounds of\nletters with sample words and to allow the writer to use the letter as (s)he\npronounces it in that particular word. \n\nSince sound changes are fairly uniform throughout any dialect, this should\nstill represent the same phoneme.  For example, we could say that /E/\nrepresents the vowel found in &quot;day&quot;, and it will always be used for that\nphoneme, no matter how you actually pronounce it. \n\nSB: Would E indicate /aI/ in Oz-speak?\n\nIf your dialect says [F], you still write /E/, and you do it consistently.\nAustralians will just learn a different sound-sign assignment and pronounce\nit their way unless they&#39;re speaking in a different accent.\n\n\nI&#39;m reminded of an article on the value of morphemic spelling, which you can\nfind here:\nhttp://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j2/gregersen.html\n\nSB: If you spell kids and boys with an s, then you are engaged in morphemic\nspelling which says that the plural will be spelled &lt;s&gt; no matter how it is\npronounced.  boyz = boys. \n\n--Steve\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
