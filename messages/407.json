I have been writing in Quickscript for about 8 years and I use it for about %90 of my daily writing.  Also I\ufffdm the person who built and uploaded the quickscript dictionary here. It is a American English dictionary and it surely uses all of the sounds.  The \ufffdawe\ufffd, the \ufffdah\ufffd, ...\n\n \nI will agree that there are distinct differences between British and American English, but I think Quickscript handles all of the sounds in a fine manner and I do not see any loss in having a few letters in it that are not used by all.\n\nkyudosha &lt;kyudosha@...&gt; wrote:\nYeah, it&#39;s a Brit thing.  Because it was written by a British-\nspeaking man, Quickscript does indeed show some bias towards the \ntraditional English way of pronounciation.  &quot;Visual&quot;, for example, is \nspelled in the manual thusly: 10/26/12/17+40/36/24, whereas an \nAmerican would be inclined to spell it 10/26/_14_/...\n\nThis bias also makes for some interesting differences when using \nletters 32-34, which to our ears are all pronounced the same.  As \nnear as I can tell, there should be no need for an American to use \nletter 34 at ALL, save that it abbreviates &quot;on&quot;.  I have made this \nchoice based upon my research so far.  34 is useful to American \nenglish speakers not as an &quot;ah&quot; sound, but as the o-spelled sound \nthat directly preceeds &quot;r&quot; in such words as &quot;or&quot; &quot;north&quot; &quot;sore&quot;, \netc... examples from the Quickscript manual confirm this usage.  \n\nLetter 20 is also unused by Americans, but serves as a nice \nabbreviation for &quot;what&quot;. In fact, I would be inclined to say that \nboth 20 AND 34 could be stricken from the alphabet for all english \nspeakers and Readscript would not suffer because of it.\n\nFor my purposes, all &quot;ah&quot; sounds I spell with 32, all &quot;o[r]&quot; sounds I \nspell with 33, and 34 is utterly unused, save to abbreviate &quot;on&quot;, \nwhich I am considering dropping as well.\n\nThis will doubtless cause some people to get up-in-arms, but I am \nalso interested in the discourse, and if I am wrong, then this will \nnot be the first time. ;)\n\n-Andy\n\n--- In Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com, &quot;steveb_667&quot; &lt;sbartok1632@e...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; I am curious as to why terminal unstressed -ior is spelt with \nletters\n&gt; #26+#36+#25 & terminal -ion (with y-sound) is spelt with letters\n&gt; #17+#36+#23.
