But if publishers<br>\nadopt it, they will want a standardized spelling, preferably an<br>\ninternational one. It&#39;s true that English has never had an academy,but<br>\nthat doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t have standardized spellings, which are<br>\nhistorically maintained by a feedback loop between publishers and<br>\nlexicographers. Dictionaries record the spellings actually used<br>\nby publishers, and then publishers adopt those same dictionaries as<br>\nauthorities for their house spellings.<br>\n  <br>\nIt&#39;s already very annoying to publishers to have to put out multiple<br>\neditions of a book in various national spellings: a real break with TO<br>\nwould immediately lead to calls for a unified spelling for all published<br>\nworks (which would then be the one taught in schools, etc.). If you<br>\ndon&#39;t want that to be a purely American version, since Americans are<br>\nboth numerically and politically dominant, then a plan for international<br>\nstandard QS had better be in place from the start.<br>\n  <br>\n-- <br>\nMos Eisley spaceport.
