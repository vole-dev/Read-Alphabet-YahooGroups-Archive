Typing in QS wi=\r\nth this mapping is about a zillion times easier than using the mapping Jero=\r\nme was originally set for, which is in line with the Shavian mapping.  Addi=\r\ntionally, the new mapping permits use of all the half-letters and ligature =\r\nletters, alternative &quot;n&quot; and schwa symbols.  These, of course, can be ignor=\r\ned if one is still working in junior QS, but they are there ready to be use=\r\nd when you are ready to move on to senior QS.  Despite what some in the Sha=\r\nvian group have said, I feel the additions Read made to QS after extensive =\r\ntesting make it a beautiful script that, even in a computer font, shows its=\r\n flexibility and artistry.  I would like to see more QS fonts developed.  A=\r\nny potential font-makers in our group?\n\nI believe there is nothing like rea=\r\nding other people&#39;s QS to improve your own reading fluency.  And, if you ha=\r\nven&#39;t tried it, start taking a few notes during your day in QS.  When you g=\r\net good at it, it is almost as efficient as shorthand.\n\nThanks again to Ewo=\r\nut Stam for helping me get it through my head that Keyman would work with t=\r\nhe existing Jerome font.\n\nPaige Gabhart\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_000D_01C1DE8F.EF6137A0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 5.00.2614.3500&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Everyon=\r\ne,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Scott ha=\r\ns set up a site where discussion about QS \nor Shavian can take place plus e=\r\nasy practice reading and typing in QS.&nbsp; &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.cookeys=\r\n.net/~shavian/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi&quot;&gt;http://www.cookeys.net/~shavian/cgi-bi=\r\nn/ikonboard.cgi&lt;/A&gt;&nbsp; \nI would suggest following my last post on (I bel=\r\nieve) March 29 and get Keyman on \nyour computer.&nbsp; Typing in QS with th=\r\nis mapping is about a zillion times \neasier than using the mapping Jerome w=\r\nas originally set for, which is in line \nwith the Shavian mapping.&nbsp; Ad=\r\nditionally, the new mapping permits use of all \nthe half-letters and ligatu=\r\nre letters,&nbsp;alternative &quot;n&quot; and schwa \nsymbols.&nbsp; These, of course=\r\n, can be ignored if one is still working in \njunior QS, but they are there =\r\nready to be used when you are ready to move on to \nsenior QS.&nbsp; Despite=\r\n what some in the Shavian group have said, I feel the \nadditions Read made =\r\nto QS after extensive testing make it a beautiful script \nthat, even in a c=\r\nomputer font, shows its flexibility and artistry.&nbsp; I would \nlike to se=\r\ne more QS fonts developed.&nbsp; Any potential font-makers in our \ngroup?&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I believe th=\r\nere is nothing like reading other \npeople&#39;s QS to improve your own reading =\r\nfluency.&nbsp; And, if you haven&#39;t tried \nit, start taking a few notes duri=\r\nng your day in QS.&nbsp; When you get good at \nit, it is almost as efficien=\r\nt as shorthand.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;Thanks again to Ewout Stam for helping me get it \nthrough my head that=\r\n Keyman would work with the existing Jerome \nfont.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Paige Gabhart&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/=\r\nHTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_000D_01C1DE8F.EF6137A0--\r\n\n"
