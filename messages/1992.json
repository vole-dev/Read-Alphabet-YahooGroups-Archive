Some proposals also include the eight half-letters. In order to be considered, the proposals were required to assign all free-standing Quickscript letters to upper case or lower case Roman letters. (There are not enough letters in the Roman alphabet to maintain this requirement for all of the half-letters.) Since the Jerome keyboard map does not meet this requirement, and proposals for a minimal update of the Jerome map gained no support in group discussion, it is not included among the final candidates. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis poll will close at the end of February 2008.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for voting!<br/>\n<br/>\nTed Larson Freeman<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nCHOICES AND RESULTS<br/>\n- QS-SAMPA, 0 votes, 0.00%  <br/>\n- Peter Guinness&#39;s proposal, 6 votes, 46.15%  <br/>\n- QS-B, 5 votes, 38.46%  <br/>\n- QS-Nu, 0 votes, 0.00%  <br/>\n- Moira O&#39;Brien&#39;s proposal, 2 votes, 15.38%  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information about this group, please visit <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Read_Alphabet\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Read_Alphabet</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nFor help with Yahoo!
