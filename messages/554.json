It was fascinating!<br/>\n<br/>\nI speak and read quite quickly an inflected language<br/>\n(Esperanto.)  I don&#39;t read it quite as fast as<br/>\nEnglish, but I think this is just because I&#39;ve got 30<br/>\nyears more English experience than Esperanto.  I will<br/>\nsay that Esperanto uses the accusative case to provide<br/>\nit much greater flexibility in word order than English<br/>\nhas.  For example, in English &quot;I am drinking milk&quot; can<br/>\nbe pretty much said and written only in that word<br/>\norder.  Esperanto is perfectly happy with &quot;Mi trinkas<br/>\nlakton,&quot; &quot;Lakton trinkas mi,&quot; &quot;Mi lakton trinkas,&quot;<br/>\netc.  The accusative really doesn&#39;t seem to come in to<br/>\nword recognition, more like meaning recognition or<br/>\npart-of-speach recognition.  I don&#39;t know if this<br/>\nhelps.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding Abijads like Arabic or Hebrew (see<br/>\nwww.omniglot.com), I&#39;d be interested to find out if<br/>\nreading is faster in Arabic when the vowels are<br/>\nincluded than when they are not.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting stuff!<br/>\ndelrayva<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Jon Zuck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jz@...\">jz@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Interesting question, Jeff.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I really doubt the importance of phonetic<br/>\n&gt; orthography in reading speed, <br/>\n&gt; at least with mature, avid readers who are well past<br/>\n&gt; the sounding-it-out <br/>\n&gt; stage.
