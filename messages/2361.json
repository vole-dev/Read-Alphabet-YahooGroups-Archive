(Most people don&#39;t realize that.) The\n              sound of letter=\r\n #33 occurs frequently in Britain, as well\n              as New York / New =\r\nJersey / New England. In my\n              pronunciation the #33 never occur=\r\ns at all, as it&#39;s totally\n              replaced by #32. In my speaking the=\r\n sound of #34 is also\n              almost completely replaced by #32; I ha=\r\nve the #32 sound\n              only before an &quot;l&quot; or an &quot;r&quot;, and in dipthon=\r\ngs (in which\n              case it&#39;s not written in QS, of course, since it=\r\n has\n              specific letters for diphthongs). &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; Anyway, just want to encourage you to look carefu=\r\nlly\n              at those, regardless of what conclusions you reach.&lt;br&gt;\n =\r\n             &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; Kind Regards, &lt;br&gt;\n              =\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; Scott&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n             =\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n          \n      \n      &lt;!-- end gr=\r\noup email --&gt;\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;pre class=3D&quot;moz-sig=\r\nnature&quot; cols=3D&quot;72&quot;&gt;-- \n=93Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed =\r\nof ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal shar=\r\ning of misery.=94 =97 Winston Churchill\n\n\n&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br class=3D&quot;webkit-bl=\r\nock-placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group e=\r\nmail --&gt;\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail=_0295415B-4925-4134-A5AD-959DECC422BF--\r\n\n"
