First let me thank you for myself and \nthe group for your willingness to put your effort and time into this for \nus all. \n\nI had not found the time to look your proposal in detail previously.  \nHere are my thoughts.\n\nFirst, a couple of minor things:\n\nAt the beginning of the proposal, there is a duplicated &quot;with.&quot;\n\n    A caseless, phonetic, left-to-right alphabet optimised for the\n    English language (but still useful for other languages with\n    similar sounds) created by (Ronald) Kingsley Read.  It is\n    the successor to and has much in common with /with/ Shavian.\n    Authoritative documentation for it can be found in \ufffdEURoeThe\n    QuikScript Alphabet\ufffdEUR?. [emphasis added]\n\nIn the following paragraph under &quot;Alternate Forms,&quot; I suggest changing \nthe word &quot;usually&quot; to &quot;highly&quot; since some letters can be properly \nconnected and some cannot.\n\n    Many letters have half height or alternate forms in order to help\n    speed up writing by reducing the number of strokes and pen lifts.\n    The half height and alternate forms are only used in \n\ufffdEUR~senior\ufffdEUR^(TM)\n    QuikScript which is /usually/ cursive. [emphasis added]\n\nWhether a given writer decides to connect any letter to another is his \nchoice, but I would consider it improper to extend or change the form of \na letter in order to make a connection to the next letter possible.  I \nbelieve the only exceptions approved by Read in the QS manual are for \nthe letters with alternate forms (N-o and U-tter) and for F-ee, M-ay and \nTH-ey.\n\nThe alternate &quot;TH-ey&quot; extends the bottom of the letter upwards to the \nlower writing line to permit connection with the next letter.  Read \nterms this an &quot;allowable extension,&quot; but it seems to me it should be \nconsidered an alternate form and listed that way in the proposal.  While \nthe end stroke of F-ee can also be extended to join the next letter, \nthat seems less important to me so, in my opinion, it could be left out \nof the proposal.  Of course, others may feel that it should be \nincluded.  I don&#39;t know how difficult it is to include these from a \ntechnical standpoint.  If we make provision for some alternate forms, \nthen adding a couple more is probably no big deal.  In looking back at \nthe manual for the first time in a long time, I realize that I almost \nhabitually use the alternate form of &quot;M-ay.&quot;  The standard form seems a \nlittle more difficult for me to write.  That may be lack of practice or \nit may have something to do with being left-handed.\n\nI am confused about your list of letters presented as having half-height \nforms.  You list 15 such letters, but the QS manual lists only P-ea, \nT-ea, H-e, D-ay, Z-oo, and W-ay.  In addition to those, I have used WH-y \nand Y-e for decades since they work as half-letters just as well as the \nsix Read suggested.  I had actually forgotten they are not listed in the \nmanual as half-letters until Jon Zuck pointed it out to me.  Since it is \nclear what letters they are, it just made sense to me.  Besides, I love \nthe way the half-letters contribute to the variety of wordshapes \npossible in QS.  However, you have added seven more:  F-ee, V-ie, S-ee, \nSH-e, J&#39;-ai, CH-eer, J-ay.  I believe this is incorrect.  Can you \nexplain how they can be used as half-height forms?\n\nI have never used the two &quot;x&quot; letters as they always struck me as \noutside the spirit of QS -- 1 phoneme to 1 symbol.  It was Read&#39;s stated \ngoal for &quot;x&quot; to &quot;compete&quot; with the TO &quot;x&quot; as if that was necessary to \navoid people deciding that QS was not viable because of two instances \nwhere it took two QS symbols when only one was needed in TO.  Should &quot;x&quot; \nbe included in the proposal.  It is in the manual, and I guess that if \nit is coded, then people can choose whether to use it or not.\n\nI&#39;m impressed with the rest of the proposal.  Thank you again for \nworking on this.\n\nPaige\n\n\r\n--------------060101030901010409090107\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot; text=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n-------- Original Message --------\n&lt;table class=&quot;moz-email-headers-table&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;\n cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th align=&quot;right&quot; nowrap=&quot;nowrap&quot; valign=&quot;baseline&quot;&gt;Subject: &lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Unicode Proposal&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th align=&quot;right&quot; nowrap=&quot;nowrap&quot; valign=&quot;baseline&quot;&gt;Date: &lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Sun, 23 Sep 2007 13:25:47 -0400&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th align=&quot;right&quot; nowrap=&quot;nowrap&quot; valign=&quot;baseline&quot;&gt;From: &lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Paige Gabhart &lt;a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-rfc2396E&quot; href=&quot;mailto:pgabhart@...&quot;&gt;&lt;pgabhart@...&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th align=&quot;right&quot; nowrap=&quot;nowrap&quot; valign=&quot;baseline&quot;&gt;To: &lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-abbreviated&quot; href=&quot;mailto:Read_alphabet@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;Read_alphabet@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\namd64_hacker:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRegarding your Unicode Proposal.&nbsp; First let me thank you for myself and\nthe group for your willingness to put your effort and time into this\nfor us all.&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI had not found the time to look your proposal in detail previously.&nbsp;\nHere are my thoughts.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nFirst, a couple of minor things:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAt the beginning of the proposal, there is a duplicated &quot;with.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A caseless, phonetic, left-to-right alphabet optimised for the&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; English language (but still useful for other languages with&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; similar sounds) created by (Ronald) Kingsley Read.&nbsp; It is&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the successor to and has much in common with &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; Shavian.&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Authoritative documentation for it can be found in &acirc;&#8364;&#339;The&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QuikScript Alphabet&acirc;&#8364;&#65533;.
