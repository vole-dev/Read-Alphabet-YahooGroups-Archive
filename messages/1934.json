  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-193881432\">I&#39;ve uploaded a pdf file (qs_keybd_proposals-grid.pdf) based on <br/>\nMoira&#39;s spreadsheet, which shows the proposed keyboard mappings laid <br/>\nout on a keyboard-like grid.  This is how I would prefer to make <br/>\ncomparisons, and I&#39;ve posted it in case anyone else finds it useful.  <br/>\nI might later tweak it to include Moira&#39;s indications of levels of <br/>\nconsensus.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we settle on a mapping which includes the senior letters, I&#39;d like <br/>\nto use a tool like SCIM (www.scim-im.org) to automate the use of the <br/>\nalternative forms and half letters.  This would automatically replace <br/>\njunior forms with appropriate senior forms as you type, e.g. <br/>\ntyping /ys/ (in QS-SAMPA) would result in /Vs/ on the screen.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nalready tried this for the ligatures in Paul Tremblay&#39;s Thoth fonts, <br/>\nand it works quite nicely.  Of course the hard work would be drawing <br/>\nup the table of automatic replacements to insert.  (Sorry Windows and <br/>\nMac users, SCIM is a Linux tool.)  Has anyone else used SCIM?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthony DH</div>",
