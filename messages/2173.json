I always make the distinction between Why and Way and always have.  =\r\nThat is my natural pronunciation, but I know that I am in the minority now =\r\nin the U.S.  I have five brothers and I am the eldest.  The brother born af=\r\nter me also pronounces Why.  The other three do not, and we were all raised=\r\n in the same family.  It seems very curious to me for this difference in sp=\r\neech to exist over such a short period of time.\n\n  I suspect that you think=\r\n of the &quot;h&quot; in the digraph &quot;wh&quot; as a silent letter.  I recently heard of an=\r\n elementary teacher, who, no doubt, shared your lack of Why in her idiolect=\r\n, and she taught her students that the &quot;h&quot; was silent.  I was stunned becau=\r\nse it was clear that she viewed her idiolect as &quot;normal&quot; and did not realiz=\r\ne that a significant percentage of the U.S. population still pronounces the=\r\n &quot;h.&quot;\n\n  I use the Why symbol because I pronounce it.  Those who don&#39;t pron=\r\nounce it, presumably don&#39;t use the symbol.  It does not cause any difficult=\r\ny in reading in my opinion.\n\n  I also make the distinction between Awe-Ah-O=\r\nx.  When I hear someone pronounce &quot;nautical&quot; as if it were spelled &quot;notical=\r\n&quot; it seems very peculiar to me.  How do you pronounce the word &quot;Awe&quot;?  Does=\r\n it just sound like the vowel in &quot;on&quot;?\n\n  Good luck in your QS studies.  I =\r\nhope the site is useful to you and that you make good progress.
