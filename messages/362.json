  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1780714242\">Thanks for the critique.<br/>\n<br/>\n   One point that I want to make is that QSJ Block is a QuickScript<br/>\nJunior font; I intended that no letters &#39;link&#39;, that there be visible<br/>\nspace between - except for the ligatures. This font was intended more<br/>\nfor (my own ;) instructional value rather than as a full-fledged<br/>\nusable font.<br/>\n   One problem I and some of my friends had was that they couldn&#39;t<br/>\ntell where one character ended and another started.<br/>\n   My intention was to create another version later, named QSS Block,<br/>\nwith full linking between appropriate letters.<br/>\n<br/>\n   That said, I certainly did want to *indicate* the proper joining<br/>\nspots, and it seems I failed in some places.<br/>\n   There are certainly a lot of combinations to kern together!<br/>\n<br/>\n   I think my main design problem was looking at it on the screen<br/>\nonly; in the future I&#39;ll certainly print it out at large sizes with<br/>\nplenty of text to try to catch these mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I must say I still don&#39;t see the problem with descenders you<br/>\nmentioned. Just what do you mean by &#39;negative space&#39;? <br/>\n   I used certain proportions (golden ratio) to create the characters;<br/>\nthe tall characters had a height of 100, the short characters 62, and<br/>\nthe descenders 38 (62% of 62%). This is in accordance with various<br/>\nwidely used fonts, and is *supposed* to be foolproof. My one problem<br/>\nwas in defining the width of a character, since the usual &#39;m&#39; and &#39;n&#39;<br/>\nmeasures wouldn&#39;t work with such a different alphabet.<br/>\n   I decided that the &#39;rounder&#39; characters would fit a square in the<br/>\nbody line, with a width of 62.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I noticed one problem in &quot;Existing&quot;; the /gi/ (Gig If).
