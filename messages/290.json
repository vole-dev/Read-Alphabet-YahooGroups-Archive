  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-885420786\">Chuck:<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you regarding letting accent come through in the spelling. <br/>\nI do not see that it is a big problem if people spell words according to <br/>\ntheir pronunciation of those words. The alternative would be to impose <br/>\nan external standard for spelling. In other words, one would have to <br/>\nconvince people to accept and use a pronunciation other than their own <br/>\nto determine how words should be spelt. Of course, despite the alleged <br/>\n&quot;good intentions&quot; of the group attempting to impose the &quot;standard,&quot; <br/>\nthose asked to spell with someone else&#39;s pronunciation will probably <br/>\ninevitably believe their own dialect is considered inferior to the <br/>\n&quot;standard&quot; as they are instructed not to use it. The result would <br/>\nprobably be that they would resist using the new alphabet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second and more serious problem is that if one has to learn an <br/>\nartificial standard, then that defeats, at least to some extent, the <br/>\nwhole purpose of alphabet reform. I believe it is fair to say most of <br/>\nthe people on the Shavian group have concluded that a &quot;standard&quot; is <br/>\nnecessary although some believe a British version and an American <br/>\nversion would probably be advantageous. This would reduce the level of <br/>\nphonicity (1 to 1 correspondence between speech and spelling) of QS.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, accepting this argument puts us back, at least to some <br/>\nextent, into the situation we are in now in which words are spelt in <br/>\nways which the individual&#39;s pronunciation does not match. English <br/>\nspeakers have been stuck with an alphabet that works so poorly for so <br/>\nlong, that when you try to reorganize it, even the people interested in <br/>\nreform want to return to a system with less phonicity almost immediately <br/>\nby alleging it is &quot;necessary.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what is necessary is communication. The only reason to be concerned <br/>\nwhether there is a &quot;standard&quot; spelling is if it negatively affects <br/>\ncommunication. I do not believe it will prevent people from deciphering <br/>\nwords written in QS since language is full of redundancies. Nor do I <br/>\nbelieve it will even slow a person&#39;s reading speed appreciably once they <br/>\nhave attained QS fluency.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor beginners using junior QS, we could develop a system to mark the <br/>\nvowel of the accented syllable. This might be useful initially.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour comment regarding &quot;those who would want to note any shortness&quot; was <br/>\nobscure to me. The &quot;hot&quot; vowel is short. The longer vowel in brit-speak <br/>\n&quot;father&quot; I seldom use.
