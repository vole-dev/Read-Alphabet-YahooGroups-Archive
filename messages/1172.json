What I am wondering is how do you pronounce the word <br/>\n&gt; &quot;awe&quot; itself as in what one experiences in connection with the deity?  <br/>\n&gt; Does that also come out as &quot;ah&quot;?  I have difficulty imagining someone <br/>\n&gt; saying, &quot;I stand in ah before God.&quot;  To me that is the sound the doctor <br/>\n&gt; tells you to make before using a tongue depressor, not a separate word <br/>\n&gt; by itself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know this probably sounds parochial, but I have never had anyone <br/>\n&gt; answer this question before.  And if, in fact, people whose dialect has <br/>\n&gt; undergone this merger still pronounce the word &quot;awe&quot; as a stand-alone <br/>\n&gt; diphthong, why would they eschew it in other settings, such as <br/>\n&gt; &quot;nautical.&quot;  The answer, I would suspect, is that English<br/>\northography is <br/>\n&gt; so hopelessly messed up that it causes no cognitive dissonance to <br/>\n&gt; pronounce the same letters one way in one word and quite differently in <br/>\n&gt; other words.
