  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1703807539\">I&#39;m happy to see that this group consists of a lot of computer literate <br/>\nposters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need help in setting up my computer so I can read and compose <br/>\nQuickscript. I am typing on a Mac which has 10.3. I am using Thuderbird <br/>\nas my email viewer, but I can easily switch. To compose text in <br/>\nQuickscript, I use MS Word (yuck!) simply because I didn&#39;t have to <br/>\nconfigure it. I simply downloaded the Kingsley font, double clicked on <br/>\nthe .ttf file, which installed the font. The font was then available in <br/>\nWord as well as Firefox.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a linux box, but I don&#39;t really want to use this, simply <br/>\nbecause the monitor is so darn big, and I like to just have one computer <br/>\nin our apartment, my girlfriend&#39;s laptop. I prefer the linux box and <br/>\nknow how to write complicated scripts to convert text. (I wrote an <br/>\nscript rtf2xml, available at sourceforge.) I know about different types <br/>\nof encoding and working with unicode.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a first step, I would like to set up latex so I can write in <br/>\nQuickscript. I don&#39;t think that should pose a herculean challenge. I <br/>\nknow I have to convert the ttf file to a font metrics, install the font <br/>\nmetrics in the right TeX folder, and then in the LaTeX file tell LaTeX <br/>\nto use this font. Has anyone done this? Adding fonts in LaTeX--though <br/>\nnot herculean--never proceeds easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf posters know of a better way of composing text besides LaTeX, I would <br/>\nlike to hear. I know that even if I get the Fonts installed in LaTeX, <br/>\nwhen I type a document, rather than Seeing Quicksript characters I will <br/>\nsee their ASCII counterparts (F wil sI His).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul</div>",
