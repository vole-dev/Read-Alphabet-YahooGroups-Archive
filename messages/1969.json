  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-497072818\">I&#39;ve been thinking about alternative and half letters in my <br/>\nproposal.  I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that I shouldn&#39;t include the <br/>\nalternative nor half letters within the 7 bit ACSII range. eg: I <br/>\nwould not map them to the latin lower nor uppercase letters. These <br/>\nletters, I would place in the extended ACSII range.  By placing them <br/>\nthere it deliberately makes it more difficult for people to type <br/>\nthem thus discouraging people from using these letters.   (Note: I <br/>\nwould still map the letters for &quot;ks&quot;, &quot;gz&quot;, loch and llan to the <br/>\nlatin letters.  Since there is only one grapheme for these letters.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI donot support the use of alternative letters for typed text for <br/>\nthe following reasons:<br/>\n-most people would be too lazy to type the alternatives instead they <br/>\nwould just use the one form.  This has happened with traditional <br/>\northography once the strict formal requirement for capitalization of <br/>\nletters at the start of sentences is relaxed- eg: in less formal <br/>\ncommunications such as phone texting or internet messaging where <br/>\npeople choose to use only the lower case. <br/>\n-causes inconsistency in typed text.  Some people would use junior, <br/>\nsome a combination of junior and senior while others (I think very <br/>\nfew though) would use true senior.<br/>\n-slows down typing until all the various letter combinations that <br/>\noccur have been learnt.  ie: Initially have to pause and think which <br/>\nalternative to use before it becomes automatic to type<br/>\n-if quikscript was ever to become widely popular and printed <br/>\nmaterial was published in quikscript I would be very surprised if <br/>\npublishers used senior.  This is due to the fact that fluent reading <br/>\nof senior script requires further learning and more practise than <br/>\njunior. I image that publishers would publish text in the junior <br/>\nversion so that could be read by the greatest number.  I&#39;m an <br/>\nexample of this, I can read junior fluently but have not bothered to <br/>\nlearn senior.<br/>\n-the junior looks more uniform and neat than the senior when typed <br/>\n(well it does to me anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people do want to produce or read senior text, than this would <br/>\nbest be achieved by using software to convert typed junior (or a <br/>\njunior/senior mix) into true senior (or a specific mix of <br/>\njunior/senior).  Software would produce a more consistent and <br/>\naccurate senior text than manual methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf some people really do want to type the senior alternatives <br/>\nregularly they could use a keyboard mapping* that maps an &quot;alt-gr&quot; <br/>\nkeypress combined with the junior key for the letter.  Eg: half-poe <br/>\nwould then be typed &quot;alt-gr&quot;+&quot;p&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that senior is best left for advanced handwriting and junior <br/>\nfor typed text.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Just to clear up terminology a bit. <br/>\nThe term &quot;keyboard mapping&quot; has not been used correctly all the time <br/>\nin the group here (I&#39;ve personally been very guilty of this).
