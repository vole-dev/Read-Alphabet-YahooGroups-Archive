  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-537211219\">I see that no one&#39;s been posting, so I thought I&#39;d put in my thoughts <br/>\nabout spelling reform and such.  Personally, I don&#39;t think it should <br/>\nmatter how you spell something, even in Quikscript.  If it was ever <br/>\nadopted by any national government, it would probably be changed by <br/>\nthe American government to spell words the way the vast majority of <br/>\nAmericans pronounce words.  I don&#39;t see why it matters that much, <br/>\neither, because the British and the Australians and everyone else <br/>\nspell words the exact same way in orthodox English spelling, even if <br/>\nthe pronunciation is different in their country.  An example: the <br/>\nword &#39;letter&#39; is spelled the same way in England and Australia as it <br/>\nis here.  Yet, in those 2 countries, they pronounce it more <br/>\nlike &quot;lettah.&quot;  They don&#39;t seem to be complaining about the spelling <br/>\nto anyone, or spelling it differently, so they probably wouldn&#39;t (or <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t) care if we spell the words our way, they&#39;ll pronounce it <br/>\ntheir own way anyway.  That, or if someone complains, just make a <br/>\ngeneral spelling list, something not based on any particular <br/>\npronunciation (which would be difficult, I realize), which can apply <br/>\nto all countries and pronunciations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOr, another alternative, is to make an abjad for English (an alphabet <br/>\nwhich normally only indicates consonants, but usually has a way to <br/>\nindicate vowels should indication be necessary).  I&#39;ve been working <br/>\non one myself, and it is rather difficult, but it can be done.  That <br/>\nway, only the consonants, which are the constants of the words, will <br/>\nremain.  The vowels, the variables, can be added/changed to a <br/>\ncountry&#39;s will.  Standard spelling, however, will rarely indicate <br/>\nvowels, and make everyone happy.  For foreign learners of English, <br/>\nvowel diacritics/letters can be added to aid them in learning the <br/>\npronunciation, like in Hebrew.  Vowel letters/diacritics can also be <br/>\nused to indicate pronunciation in words that would be ambiguous <br/>\notherwise (i.e. ten, tin would only be spelled &#39;tn&#39;).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has any comments, which I&#39;m sure everyone does, post away.</div>",
