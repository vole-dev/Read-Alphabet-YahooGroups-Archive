But I&#39;d like to make <br/>\nsure I&#39;m sending you the right sort of updates: as I don&#39;t speak <br/>\nAmerican English, I don&#39;t want to send you material which doesn&#39;t fit <br/>\ninto an American dictionary. (For this reason I&#39;ll stay clear of <br/>\nsending vowel changes!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some questions for you:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Cases of Dropped #3Tea.<br/>\nAs I said in post 1467, I don&#39;t like the dropped #3Tea in many QS <br/>\nnews words.  An example is &quot;implementing&quot; which was converted <br/>\nto ...#28Et-#23No-#26It-#21iNG.  Should we put the #3Tea in (to <br/>\nget ...#28Et-#23No-#3Tea-#26It-#21iNG), or is the dropped #3Tea a <br/>\nwidespread Americanism which should remain?<br/>\n<br/>\n(Cases of dropped tea - are we revisiting the Boston Tea Party?)<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Cases of Dropped #19He.<br/>\n&quot;Human&quot; was transcribed as #17Ye-#40OOze-#22May-#36Utter-#23No.  <br/>\nShould this be #19He-#17Ye-#40OOze... or H-dropping the norm in <br/>\nAmerica?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Quickscript manual abbreviations<br/>\nShould we implement QS manual abbreviations, such as #21iNG (instead <br/>\nof -#26It-#21iNG) for the gerund-participle suffix &quot;ing&quot;?  Do you <br/>\nwant to do these one-by-one, or leave them for you to do a global <br/>\nupdate at some point?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Naming dot<br/>\nWhich character should we use for a naming dot in a text file?  Just <br/>\na standard &quot;.&quot;, or something else?<br/>\n<br/>\n4. File format<br/>\nDO you want DOS or Unix format files?  CR-LF, or just LF?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne area I can certainly help in the dictionary is Korean names.  (An <br/>\nobscure topic, but there have been a few Korean stories in the QS <br/>\nnews.)  I learnt a little bit of Korean - enough to know that TO <br/>\ntranscriptions of Korean names can be misleading.  In QS we can do <br/>\nbetter!<br/>\n<br/>\n(Off topic, but the Korean alphabet, Hangul, was designed in the 15th <br/>\ncentury to reflect the actual sounds of Korean.  It&#39;s a brilliant <br/>\npiece of work, and many of the letters actually resemble the way the <br/>\nletter is articulated in the mouth.  So when I first came across <br/>\nQuickscript, the similarities to Hangul were striking.)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, Anthony DH</div>",
