Try to understand the confusion this creates, especially<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for beginners. At the same time, I don&#39;t think Read wanted one letter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to serve for different sounds. I believe he wanted the opposite: one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; letter equals one and only one sound.

For those who don&#39;t have any linguistics background, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have proposed that we give much fuller, linguist-*like_ descriptions<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the letters, and Anthony Grahn has agreed to making such a chart.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Thanks, Anthony!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello Paul<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s already a table with the QS alphabet and IPA equivalents at <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/writing/quikscript.htm\">http://www.omniglot.com/writing/quikscript.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; and the spreadsheet used to make it is available at <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/charts/alternative.xls.\">http://www.omniglot.com/charts/alternative.xls.</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If that can help...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; JF<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
