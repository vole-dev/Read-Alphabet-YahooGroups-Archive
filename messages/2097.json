If anyone wants to help determine how these words should be handled please feel free to make a recommendation- eg.you could suggest a new rule for the proposal to handle one of groupings.<br/>\nI&#39;m currently working on the top 500 lemmatized nouns- about half way.  After that I only have the verbs to go till I consider the project basically complete.  Then I will then produce some example text using these spellings to see what people think of it- it will probably be an internation QS version of &quot;Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There&quot; by Lewis Carol.  This will be quite awhile yet.</div>",
