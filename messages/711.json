Firstly, there is the overloaded &quot;ado/up&quot;<br/>\n&gt; vowel, for which there are two characters in shavian but only one in<br/>\n&gt; quickscript.  Secondly, the shavian proposal included several<br/>\n&gt; diphthongs as separate glyph encodings, &quot;ian&quot; &quot;ear&quot; &quot;air&quot; etc.  These<br/>\n&gt; really should NOT be separate glyphs: they should be entered and<br/>\n&gt; stored as two separate glyphs, and only presented as ligatures when<br/>\n&gt; they are displayed.  Giving ligatures a separate encoding will play<br/>\n&gt; hell with sorting/searching, etc.  In the same way, characters for<br/>\n&gt; which there are multiple glyphs, such as the multiple ways of writing<br/>\n&gt; &quot;may&quot; and &quot;no&quot;, should have only a single encoding but multiple<br/>\n&gt; associated glyphs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What certainly has not gotten off the ground is a formal Unicode<br/>\n&gt; proposal.
