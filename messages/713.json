  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-383841954\">Hello all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been learning Quickscript off and on for a few months.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s one of those &quot;spare time&quot; things that there&#39;s rarely any spare time for.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn looking for improved PDA input methods I have run across some interesting programs that might be of use to the Quickscript/Shavian users.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, check out Dasher.  This is an innovated input method used primarily with the disabled, but it&#39;s finding all sorts of other uses.  It uses a<br/>\nscrolling method where letters approach from one side of the screen and move toward the other.  The user aims the pointed at the desired letter,<br/>\nand as the letter passes the pointer it is added to the currently forming word.  Dasher learns frequently used words the more it is used, so as a<br/>\nuser picks letters Dasher imphasizes the letters that are most likely to come next.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other neat thing about Dasher is that it is possible to create any language set for Dasher by creating a new xml file.  Thus, Dasher could be<br/>\nused as an input method for Quickscript/Shavian that doesn&#39;t required remapping the keyboard or trying to figure out which letter corresponds to<br/>\nwhich symbol.  I haven&#39;t had a chance to fiddle with this yet, and, unfortunately, it looks like it may require the character set to be supported in unicode.<br/>\n<br/>\nDasher is available for Windows, Linux, Pocket PC, and Mac.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/\">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone&#39;s got it doing Klingon, Ogham, and Runic.  See the very bottom of the page.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/ALPHABETS.html\">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/ALPHABETS.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting program for Pocket PC users is InPad.  This is a replacement input method that works sort of like the block recognizer or<br/>\nGrafiti on Palm devices.  However, it allows the creation of customer character inputs by using a grid.  The user can draw a character on the<br/>\ngrid, and based on which grid boxes are connected and in what order determines which character was drawn.  I was working on a Quickscript character set for it, but my PDA got wiped out a while back and I haven&#39;t gone back to InPad yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe major negative point for InPad is that it&#39;s not free.  It does have a trial version, but after twenty days or so it requires registration.  InPad is also a little tricky since a lot of characters could use the same grid patterns, so it would require starting different symbols at different points in the grid just to differentiate them all.<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.inpad.net<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething to consider for the Unicode usage might be the ConScript Unicode Registry.  (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/)\">http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/)</a>  This is a registry to track constructed languages and other scripts that will probably never be made into an official Unicode page.  There&#39;s a Unicode area reserved for private use, and the ConScript Registry is helping people use this private area without stepping on each others&#39; toes.  We could register Quickscript here temporarily until an actual Unicode page area gets approved.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, using the private use area means making new fonts that use the new unicode mappings, and then redoing those fonts, and documents created<br/>\nwith those fonts, later if the real Unicode mappings go through.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn an unrelated note, I&#39;m going to toot my own horn and point everyone at the page below.  I started working on some Quickscript lessons for my<br/>\nown use.  I have two completed, and am half way through a third one.  They are helpful for me in practicing drawing the symbols and remembering the sounds.  I based the lessons loosely on Read&#39;s suggestions, and I was going for a textbook style to the lessons.  They&#39;re rather plain at the moment, but functional.  If anyone else finds them useful please let me know, and I will post here as I complete more of them.  Also, suggestions are welcome on improvements or changes that would help new students learn the script.<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.corporate-slave.com/quickscript.html<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nEdward Boudreaux</div>",
