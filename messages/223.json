Would that mean I&#39;d have to give up<br/>\nputting my U in colour? I guess I have to anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy solution to the problem of squabbling between Americans, English<br/>\nand Australians over who speaks &#39;proper&#39; english is to let it be done<br/>\nby either New Zealanders, the Scottish or the english speaking Indian<br/>\npopulation. Sure we wouldn&#39;t have any comprehension of the<br/>\npronounciation but at least nobody feels threatened by the global<br/>\ntakeover of Scottish culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, then. How about Canada? They sound pretty damn similar to<br/>\namericans but nobody seems to hate them (except Quebecians). Their<br/>\nversion of english is about as phonetically, culturally and<br/>\ndiplomatically neutral as they come.<br/>\n<br/>\n--end of bullshit<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I only encountered Shavian/Read recently, I never really looked<br/>\nat the Shavian community. I just heard that Read had improved his<br/>\noriginal and so I just skipped straight to Quikscript. But from<br/>\ndiscussions here it would seem that the Shavian community is<br/>\nconsiderably bigger. Does anyone know why? Is it just that it&#39;s older?  <br/>\n<br/>\nCould someone please point out any positive points to Shavian - why it<br/>\nmight be better than quikscript.
