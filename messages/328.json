What you need to realize, however, is that <br/>\nnobody really thinks about their vowels in terms of front, mid, mid-<br/>\nfront, etcetera when they say them, so any mnemonic value that might <br/>\nbe gained by placing the vowels at varying horizontal positions is <br/>\nlost.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, it is difficult to write this way.  Having letters at the <br/>\nupper parallel or writing line is fine, but letters in the middle <br/>\nwill lack consistency because there is nothing against which to judge <br/>\nthem.  Ergo, they will tend to float upwards or downwards.  It is my <br/>\nopinion that you should simply move all vowels down to the writing <br/>\nline -- they are distinct enough from one another as they are.
