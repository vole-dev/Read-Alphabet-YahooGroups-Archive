That does not render QS useless or a toy.  In <br/>\n&gt; fact, it renders it more useful because it has flexibility which the IPA <br/>\n&gt; cannot have and enables it to work for, essentially, all English speakers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think I have conveyed my sentiment clearly, so I apologize. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t mean for QS to be as precise as IPA. Nor do I mean to say that we <br/>\nshould change the way that words are spelled in different contexts, as a <br/>\ntrue linguistic rendering would require. We are in full agreement when <br/>\nwe say that it does not matter if the &quot;p&quot; is apirated or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am prosing is an accurate way to describe words in their ideal <br/>\ncontext, which I guess usually mean alone. Let&#39;s take the letter &quot;On,&quot; <br/>\n#35. This vowel is used in the word ox, which dictionary.com lists the <br/>\nIPA describes the vowel in this word as:<br/>\n<br/>\n\u0252<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the the mouth being fully open and the pronounced at the back of <br/>\nthe mouth with rounded lips. This should be exactly as all of us who <br/>\nunderstand IPA think about this vowel. (Let me address how those without <br/>\nlinguistic knowledge will think of this below.) There should be no room <br/>\nfor ambiguity. I strongly advocate that we set this as a standard, <br/>\nperhaps in a FAQ for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel the advantages of describing letter in IPA is thus:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. We give QS a precision. For example, we would allow QS to represent <br/>\ndialects accurately. When an expert in QS writes dialect, say in a <br/>\nstory, we can know exactly what he means.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. We avoid the ambiguity that plagues the manual right now and gives <br/>\nboth beginners and experts a head ache. For example, the revised <br/>\nalphabet  gives the narme &quot;On&quot; to letter 34. If you look this up at <br/>\ndictionary.com, you find that the vowel in this word can be either #33 <br/>\nor #34! So the very example, used in a revised alphabet, once again <br/>\ncreates ambiguity.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t think this is a problem, just read some of the emails that <br/>\nthis thread has generated. It seems many beginners (including myself) <br/>\nstumble on 32, 33 & 34. It takes us a while to realize that many <br/>\ndialects don&#39;t distinguish between these.<br/>\n<br/>\nDescribing a word in terms of other words is simply circular reasoning <br/>\nand unhelpful. Let me repeat: the manual is very inadequate in this <br/>\nrespect, as is the shawtwo document. I have had to do a lot of work on <br/>\nmy own to try to work on my own to decipher exactly what is meant by <br/>\n#32, #33, and #34. I would rather have spent this time working on the <br/>\nfont or on a text.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. We enable more precise discussion on this issue in the future and <br/>\navoid wasting time. Even as I write this, I am still unsure if #34 does <br/>\nin fact represent the back, open, rounded vowel. It would be nice if <br/>\nthis issue came up again to simply point to a faq. This also allows us <br/>\nto settle issues in a more precise and less emotional matter. For <br/>\nexample, if a debate arises over the &quot;correct&quot; spelling of a word, we <br/>\ncan look up the the IPA of the word and say &quot;This is the *standarized* <br/>\n*American* (or British or whatever) way of spelling the word, but your <br/>\ndialect may differ.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the layman. It is true that we should never require QS users <br/>\nto have extensive or even any knowledge of linguistics. But on the one <br/>\nhand that shouldn&#39;t prevent us who do know some linguistics from using <br/>\nthe precision of its terminology. On the other hand, we should take more <br/>\ncare to describe the letters. Simply saying a letter sounds like such <br/>\nand such a word is inadequate. We could have sound recordings on a web <br/>\nsite. Or, we could say something like &quot;The &#39;Ah&#39; sound sounds like the <br/>\n&quot;a&quot; in &quot;father,&quot; for Northeastern speakers. Think of saying &quot;ahh&quot; when <br/>\nyou go to the doctor. Your mouth should be fully open (that is why the <br/>\ndoctor has you make this sound!). Many speakers outside the Northeast <br/>\nregion of the US will not pronounce father this way. In this case, you <br/>\nshould use letter #34 instead. Speakers from such and such a region will <br/>\nhardly ever use this sound...&quot; Of course, we would need even a better <br/>\ndescription than this, one that would cover different regions of the <br/>\nworld. And we probably dont&#39; need that much detail for the consanants.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me state one very good reason for using the IPA to describe lettes. <br/>\nLet&#39;s say I write a short story that takes place in Boston. I want to <br/>\nconvey the dialect. In traditional orthograpy, I can write words like <br/>\n&quot;wundaful&quot; for wonderful, and a reader would recognize what I am trying <br/>\nto convey. That is because there is a standard way in TO, so a non <br/>\nstandard spelling will make the reader see the word as pronounced <br/>\ndifferently Now if I write the story in QS, how am I to convey this <br/>\ndialect? I can write the word using the QS letters as they are described <br/>\nin the manual, but if QS users are used to using the letters sloppily, <br/>\nmixing up #32, #33, and #34, then how will they read what I mean? They <br/>\nwill simply think that I am mixing up the letters as they do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you and others consider my reasons carefully, because I would <br/>\nlike to see more clarity on this issue to avoid confusion in the future, <br/>\nand I think my suggestions would strengthen QS without making it too <br/>\nrigid, since users will always be free to spell words however they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul</div>",
