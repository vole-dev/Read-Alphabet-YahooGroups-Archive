  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-325841651\">I&#39;ve just discovered QuickScript while searching for a relatively<br/>\neasy-to-learn method of writing differently. My primary reasons for<br/>\nwanting a new way of writing is a) I tend to be wordy so an alphabet<br/>\nthat requires less work seems a blessing for my poor CTS-afflicted<br/>\nright hand; and b) I recently discovered a co-worker reading my<br/>\nplanner in which I keep notes about work-related issues. Obviously,<br/>\nI&#39;d like to keep that stuff private as it is not always favorable and<br/>\nthe abbreviation of standard English I&#39;ve started using doesn&#39;t seem<br/>\nto suffice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m only at the point of having skimmed through the manual and am<br/>\nwondering how to start. What is the best way to learn QT? Are there<br/>\ncertain letters and combinations I should start with? Shall I learn it<br/>\nthe same way my 7-year-old is learning to write and spell (i.e.,<br/>\nrepetition in writing certain letter combinations).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;m thinking of learning this side-by-side with my 7-year-old.<br/>\nShe&#39;s very bright and loves to write. She&#39;s currently engrossed in<br/>\nlearning to write standard English and printing, and I wonder if it is<br/>\nappropriate timing to try to teach her a new way to write as well, or<br/>\nbest to wait until she&#39;s more comfortable writing standard English? My<br/>\nthought is that it&#39;d be easier for her now than later, much like<br/>\nlearning a second language is easier when you&#39;re young. But I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to confuse her and have her end up with poor marks in school,<br/>\nwhich obviously is not going to encourage the use of QT as it may take<br/>\nher focus off of the All-Important-Spelling. They keep saying they&#39;re<br/>\nteaching her phonetically, but it doesn&#39;t really seem that way at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh, so many questions, but I have one more for now...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am confused about the usage of No. 26 I-t. From what I&#39;m seeing, it<br/>\nseems to work for two sounds, a soft &#39;i&#39; as in &#39;pit&#39; (or the u sound<br/>\nin busy) as well as a long &#39;ee&#39; as in &#39;see&#39; (or the y sound in busy)<br/>\nand you are supposed to use No. 26 for the &#39;ee&#39; sound made at the end<br/>\nof words that end in &#39;y&#39; such as busy? Is that correct? Does that mean<br/>\nyou would write &#39;pity&#39; as 1-26-3-26 as opposed to 1-26-3-27? Why not<br/>\njust use No. 27 EA-t which already represents this sound? Also, if No.<br/>\n26 applies to &#39;ee&#39; ending sound words that end in &#39;y&#39; such as &#39;lovely&#39;<br/>\nor &#39;money&#39; does it apply to words that end in &#39;ie&#39; but have the same<br/>\nsound, such as &#39;aerie&#39; or &#39;freebie&#39;? I&#39;m guessing as QT is based on<br/>\npronunciation, not spelling, it would. Still, I don&#39;t get 26 instead<br/>\nof 27.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that&#39;s not too much for a first post, though I imagine it is.<br/>\nAs I mentioned previously, I am exceptionally verbose, unfortunately.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, nice to have found you all and I look forward to hearing your<br/>\nthoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Ann <br/>\n30-27 (?)</div>",
