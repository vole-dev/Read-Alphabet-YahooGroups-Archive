I would like to see our membership <br/>\ncontinue to expand.  In fact, I would like to see it expand even more <br/>\nrapidly.  The more people who are introduced to QS and begin using it, <br/>\nthe more likely we are to reach a point where friends start to tell <br/>\nfriends about this great &quot;new&quot; way to write English.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf each one of us, convinced just one person in the next month to try a <br/>\nmembership in the group -- after all, it&#39;s free -- we could expand to <br/>\n600 members in short order.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would challenge you to bring the subject up with people you know who <br/>\nare curious about the world and and not afraid to be innovative.  Send <br/>\nme the names and e-mails of those who are willing to try a free, no <br/>\nstrings attached membership.  After all, what have they got to lose? I <br/>\nwill send them an invitation.  All they have to do is click on it to <br/>\naccept.  If the task of sending out invitations becomes too onerous, we <br/>\ncan always appoint new moderators to take over some of the load.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo see who in our group is willing to commit to mention QS to someone <br/>\nthey know, perhaps, a student, a professional person, or a young person <br/>\nwho would like to learn a &quot;code&quot; that no one else can read, please <br/>\nrespond to the new poll which will be e-mailed to you right after this <br/>\nmessage.  You just click &quot;Yes&quot; I&#39;m willing to try it or &quot;No thanks.&quot;   <br/>\nThis will give us an idea how many members are willing to give it a shot <br/>\nin the next month.  I am curious to see what kind of results we would <br/>\nget if we made a modest effort to get the word out to those we all know <br/>\nwho could really benefit from QS.  Come to think of it -- that is almost <br/>\neverybody we know, isn&#39;t it!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaige Gabhart<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I have convinced two new people to join in the last month.  It is <br/>\nreally not that hard.</div>",
