English phonemes are given in<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0slashes /laIk DIs/ in a SAMPA transcription modified<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0towards QS-SAMPA in that /y/ and /a/ are used rather<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0than /@/ and /{/. Phonetic transcription where\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0necessary is given in a similarly modified SAMPA in<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0square brackets [lyIk Dys].<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0My proposal is propose that *if* ligatures are to be<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0assigned to positions in QS-SAMPA this should better\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0not be done randomly, since the whole idea with QS-<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0SAMPA is to make QS-to-ASCII mappings less random.<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Seeing that the letter positions in the ASCII range are<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0essentially used up by the basic QS letters, the most\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0consistent manner of catering for ligatures would be to<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0assign them to positions corresponding to accented<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0letters in the Latin-1 encoding, so that e.g. a vowel<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0with a particular accent mark stands for &#39;the\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0corresponding QS-SAMPA vowel with following {r}&#39; and<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0another accent mark for &#39;following {n}&#39;, a third for<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0&#39;preceding {j} or {I}&#39;.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Personally I regard ligatures as &#39;typographic sugar&#39;\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0which should be regarded as by no means necessary or<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0required in ordinary typing. Looking in QM one sees<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0that those vowel+{r} combinations which happen to<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0correspond to lexical sets do *not* receive special\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0treatment compared to other combined letter sequences<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0in Read&#39;s QS handwriting. It seems to me the whole<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0business of ligatures in QS fonts is a carryover from<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Shavian typography, but as some people like them, and\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0the vowel+{r} combination do correspond to single<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0sounds in non-rhotic accents they should be catered<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0for.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0## The assignments<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0On p. 13 of QM Read gives what he intends as a full\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0list of vowel+r ligatures, which would give us<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {Er} = {\u00c9} (_merry_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {er} = {\u00e9} (_Mary_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {ar} = {\u00e1} (_marry_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {Yr} = {\u00dd} (_mire_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {Ar} = {\u00c1} (_mar_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {Or} = {\u00d3} (_more_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {ur} = {\u00fa} (_moor_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {ir} = {\u00ed} (_mere_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {yr} = {\u00fd} (_murder_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {Hr} = {\u00f8} (_sour_)<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Correspondingly, with following {n}<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {En} = {\u00cb} (_pen_)\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {en} = {\u00eb} (_pain, pane_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {an} = {\u00e4} (_pan_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {Yn} = {\u0178} (_pine_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {An} = {\u00c4} (_Juan_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {On} = {\u00d6} (_pawn_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {on} = {\u00f6} (_bone_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {un} = {\u00fc} (_soon_)\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {in} = {\u00ef} (_wean_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {yn} = {\u00ff} (_pun_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {Hn} = {\u00d8} (_town_)<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Also, though less systematic, with preceding {j} or {I}<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {ju} = {\u00f9} (_cute_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {jur} = {\u00d9} (_cure_)\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {jyn} = {\u00d2} (_onion, million)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {Iy} = {\u00e0} (_India_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {Iyn} = {\u00c0} (_Indian_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {Iyr} = {\u00c8} (_windier_)<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0This leaves the capitals _P, L, M, B, C, F_ free to<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0assign to the half-letters and the {Vl} ligature:\n    <br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- half-{p} = {P} (obvious, I hope)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- {Vl} = {L} (_ultra_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- half-{w} = {M} (_M_ is upside-down _W_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- half-{h} = {B} (_B_ is visually similar to _H_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- half-{z} = {C} (_C_ is visually similar to the QS\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0half- {z}, and _c_ is sometimes<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0/s/, the voiceless counterpart to<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0/z/...)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- half-{T} = {F} (vague visual similarity between _F_<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0and _T_)<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0And in addition:<br>\n&gt;\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- half-{d} = {\u00d0} (_Ed_)<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0- alt-{D} = {\u00f0} (_other_ {Q\u00f0yr}, [\u00f0] is IPA for<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0SAMPA [D])<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0## Notes on the assignments<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0The use of Hr = \u00f8 and Hn = \u00d8 is made necessary by the\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0fact that there is no accented H&#39;s!

However {Iy} often corresponds to TO _ia_,<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0{Iyr} to TO _ier_ and {Iyn} to TO _ian_, which<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0hopefully can work as memory cues.\n    <br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Words like _cure_ are given with [jUy(r)] in the<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0pronunciation dictionaries. The CMUPD gives some items<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0with [ju(y)r], but they are all foreign names.

It seems defensible to map this\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0ligature {jyn} {\u00d2} by analogy with {Ian} = {\u00c0}.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps {\u00d0} and {\u00f0} should be swapped so that alt-{D}<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0is {\u00d0} and half-{d} is {\u00f0}? All the other half-letters<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0are assigned to capitals however, and the IPA [\u00f0] =\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0SAMPA [D] *is* a rather solid memory cue, IMHO.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0These mappings to accented letters may be hard to type<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0with a standard British or American keyboard mapping<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0but they are infinitely more readable, and if someone\n    <br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0is in a situation where they are hard to type these<br>\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0ligatures are after all simply dispensible.

Looking in QM one sees\n&gt;     &gt;  that those vowel+{r} combinations which happen to\n&gt;     &gt;  correspond to lexical sets do *not* receive special\n&gt;     &gt;  treatment compared to other combined letter sequences\n&gt;     &gt;  in Read&#39;s QS handwriting. It seems to me the whole\n&gt;     &gt;  business of ligatures in QS fonts is a carryover from\n&gt;     &gt;  Shavian typography, but as some people like them, and\n&gt;     &gt;  the vowel+{r} combination do correspond to single\n&gt;     &gt;  sounds in non-rhotic accents they should be catered\n&gt;     &gt;  for.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  ## The assignments\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  On p. 13 of QM Read gives what he intends as a full\n&gt;     &gt;  list of vowel+r ligatures, which would give us\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  - {Er} = {\ufffd} (_merry_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {er} = {\ufffd} (_Mary_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {ar} = {\ufffd} (_marry_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {Yr} = {\ufffd} (_mire_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {Ar} = {\ufffd} (_mar_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {Or} = {\ufffd} (_more_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {ur} = {\ufffd} (_moor_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {ir} = {\ufffd} (_mere_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {yr} = {\ufffd} (_murder_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {Hr} = {\ufffd} (_sour_)\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  Correspondingly, with following {n}\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  - {En} = {\ufffd} (_pen_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {en} = {\ufffd} (_pain, pane_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {an} = {\ufffd} (_pan_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {Yn} = {\ufffd} (_pine_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {An} = {\ufffd} (_Juan_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {On} = {\ufffd} (_pawn_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {on} = {\ufffd} (_bone_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {un} = {\ufffd} (_soon_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {in} = {\ufffd} (_wean_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {yn} = {\ufffd} (_pun_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {Hn} = {\ufffd} (_town_)\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  Also, though less systematic, with preceding {j} or {I}\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  - {ju} = {\ufffd} (_cute_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {jur} = {\ufffd} (_cure_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {jyn} = {\ufffd} (_onion, million)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {Iy} = {\ufffd} (_India_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {Iyn} = {\ufffd} (_Indian_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {Iyr} = {\ufffd} (_windier_)\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  This leaves the capitals _P, L, M, B, C, F_ free to\n&gt;     &gt;  assign to the half-letters and the {Vl} ligature:\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  - half-{p} = {P} (obvious, I hope)\n&gt;     &gt;  - {Vl} = {L} (_ultra_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - half-{w} = {M} (_M_ is upside-down _W_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - half-{h} = {B} (_B_ is visually similar to _H_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - half-{z} = {C} (_C_ is visually similar to the QS\n&gt;     &gt;  half- {z}, and _c_ is sometimes\n&gt;     &gt;  /s/, the voiceless counterpart to\n&gt;     &gt;  /z/...)\n&gt;     &gt;  - half-{T} = {F} (vague visual similarity between _F_\n&gt;     &gt;  and _T_)\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  And in addition:\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  - half-{d} = {\ufffd} (_Ed_)\n&gt;     &gt;  - alt-{D} = {\ufffd} (_other_ {Q\ufffdyr}, [\ufffd] is IPA for\n&gt;     &gt;  SAMPA [D])\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  ## Notes on the assignments\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  The use of Hr = \ufffd and Hn = \ufffd is made necessary by the\n&gt;     &gt;  fact that there is no accented H&#39;s! I hope the slash on\n&gt;     &gt;  \ufffd and \ufffd will recall the crossbar on H.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  The letter _\ufffd_ (capital Y with dieresis) is not\n&gt;     &gt;  included in the Latin-1 encoding, but it is included in\n&gt;     &gt;  Windows-1252 encoding as character 159, and it can\n&gt;     &gt;  hardly hurt to include an {Yn} ligature, if desired, as\n&gt;     &gt;  character 159 in a QS-SAMPA font.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  With the acute accent essentially meaning &#39;preceding j\n&gt;     &gt;  or I&#39; those assignments are admittedly not as\n&gt;     &gt;  systematic. However {Iy} often corresponds to TO _ia_,\n&gt;     &gt;  {Iyr} to TO _ier_ and {Iyn} to TO _ian_, which\n&gt;     &gt;  hopefully can work as memory cues.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  Words like _cure_ are given with [jUy(r)] in the\n&gt;     &gt;  pronunciation dictionaries. The CMUPD gives some items\n&gt;     &gt;  with [ju(y)r], but they are all foreign names. It thus\n&gt;     &gt;  seems reasonable to assume that [Uy(r)] corresponding\n&gt;     &gt;  to _ur_ + vowel is phonemically /jur/ and should be\n&gt;     &gt;  written {jur} in QS. I&#39;ve looked for examples in QM\n&gt;     &gt;  without finding any, which isn&#39;t to say there aren&#39;t\n&gt;     &gt;  any. NB that I mistyped {jur} as {jyr} in the first\n&gt;     &gt;  version of this proposal.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  QM gives a ligature (or spelling) {jyn} corresponding\n&gt;     &gt;  to the spelling _ion_ in the words _onion, minion,\n&gt;     &gt;  pillion, million_. It seems defensible to map this\n&gt;     &gt;  ligature {jyn} {\ufffd} by analogy with {Ian} = {\ufffd}.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  Perhaps {\ufffd} and {\ufffd} should be swapped so that alt-{D}\n&gt;     &gt;  is {\ufffd} and half-{d} is {\ufffd}? All the other half-letters\n&gt;     &gt;  are assigned to capitals however, and the IPA [\ufffd] =\n&gt;     &gt;  SAMPA [D] *is* a rather solid memory cue, IMHO.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  These mappings to accented letters may be hard to type\n&gt;     &gt;  with a standard British or American keyboard mapping\n&gt;     &gt;  but they are infinitely more readable, and if someone\n&gt;     &gt;  is in a situation where they are hard to type these\n&gt;     &gt;  ligatures are after all simply dispensible. They are\n&gt;     &gt;  easy to type with the US International keyboard layout,\n&gt;     &gt;  which works reasonably well also with a British-Irish\n&gt;     &gt;  physical keyboard.

It seems to me the whole&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdbusiness of ligatures in QS fonts is a carryover from&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdShavian typography, but as some people like them, and\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdthe vowel+{r} combination do correspond to single&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdsounds in non-rhotic accents they should be catered&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdfor.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd## The assignments&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdOn p. 13 of QM Read gives what he intends as a full\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdlist of vowel+r ligatures, which would give us&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {Er} = {\ufffd} (_merry_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {er} = {\ufffd} (_Mary_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {ar} = {\ufffd} (_marry_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {Yr} = {\ufffd} (_mire_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {Ar} = {\ufffd} (_mar_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {Or} = {\ufffd} (_more_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {ur} = {\ufffd} (_moor_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {ir} = {\ufffd} (_mere_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {yr} = {\ufffd} (_murder_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {Hr} = {\ufffd} (_sour_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdCorrespondingly, with following {n}&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {En} = {\ufffd} (_pen_)\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {en} = {\ufffd} (_pain, pane_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {an} = {\ufffd} (_pan_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {Yn} = {\ufffd} (_pine_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {An} = {\ufffd} (_Juan_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {On} = {\ufffd} (_pawn_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {on} = {\ufffd} (_bone_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {un} = {\ufffd} (_soon_)\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {in} = {\ufffd} (_wean_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {yn} = {\ufffd} (_pun_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {Hn} = {\ufffd} (_town_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdAlso, though less systematic, with preceding {j} or {I}&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {ju} = {\ufffd} (_cute_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {jur} = {\ufffd} (_cure_)\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {jyn} = {\ufffd} (_onion, million)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {Iy} = {\ufffd} (_India_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {Iyn} = {\ufffd} (_Indian_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {Iyr} = {\ufffd} (_windier_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdThis leaves the capitals _P, L, M, B, C, F_ free to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdassign to the half-letters and the {Vl} ligature:\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- half-{p} = {P} (obvious, I hope)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- {Vl} = {L} (_ultra_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- half-{w} = {M} (_M_ is upside-down _W_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- half-{h} = {B} (_B_ is visually similar to _H_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- half-{z} = {C} (_C_ is visually similar to the QS\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdhalf- {z}, and _c_ is sometimes&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd/s/, the voiceless counterpart to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd/z/...)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- half-{T} = {F} (vague visual similarity between _F_&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdand _T_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdAnd in addition:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- half-{d} = {\ufffd} (_Ed_)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd- alt-{D} = {\ufffd} (_other_ {Q\ufffdyr}, [\ufffd] is IPA for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdSAMPA [D])&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd## Notes on the assignments&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdThe use of Hr = \ufffd and Hn = \ufffd is made necessary by the\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdfact that there is no accented H&#39;s!

However {Iy} often corresponds to TO _ia_,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffd{Iyr} to TO _ier_ and {Iyn} to TO _ian_, which&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdhopefully can work as memory cues.\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdWords like _cure_ are given with [jUy(r)] in the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdpronunciation dictionaries. The CMUPD gives some items&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdwith [ju(y)r], but they are all foreign names. It thus&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdseems reasonable to assume that [Uy(r)] corresponding\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdto _ur_ + vowel is phonemically /jur/ and should be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdwritten {jur} in QS.

NB that I mistyped {jur} as {jyr} in the first\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdversion of this proposal.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdQM gives a ligature (or spelling) {jyn} corresponding&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdto the spelling _ion_ in the words _onion, minion,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdpillion, million_. It seems defensible to map this\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdligature {jyn} {\ufffd} by analogy with {Ian} = {\ufffd}.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdPerhaps {\ufffd} and {\ufffd} should be swapped so that alt-{D}&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdis {\ufffd} and half-{d} is {\ufffd}? All the other half-letters&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdare assigned to capitals however, and the IPA [\ufffd] =\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdSAMPA [D] *is* a rather solid memory cue, IMHO.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdThese mappings to accented letters may be hard to type&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdwith a standard British or American keyboard mapping&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdbut they are infinitely more readable, and if someone\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdis in a situation where they are hard to type these&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdligatures are after all simply dispensible. They are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdeasy to type with the US International keyboard layout,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdwhich works reasonably well also with a British-Irish\n    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\ufffd\ufffdphysical keyboard.
