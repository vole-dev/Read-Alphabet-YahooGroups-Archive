  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-774432\">Using the Arabic script to represent English<br/>\n<br/>\nAdapting Arabic to represent spoken English would be similar to <br/>\nadapting Latin.  Spoken English has 14 pure vowels, early Latin had <br/>\n10 but only represented five.  The Arabic writing system marks five <br/>\nvowels.  Therefore, one of the first steps would be to add 9 shapes <br/>\nor diacritics to Arabic to handle the additional vowels.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Arabic writing system has other peculiarities such as medial and <br/>\nterminal forms. Arabic vowels have tone and length which can be <br/>\nmarked in the writing system. English vowels have neither although <br/>\nwe still talk about length.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Arabic writing system (ajami) has one advantage over the <br/>\nstandard Roman orthography. Standard Arabic, like Hausa, <br/>\ndistinguishes long and short vowels. Thus, when Hausa speakers write <br/>\nHausa using ajami, they show vowel length as is normally done in <br/>\nArabic, i.e. with the normal vowel points and alif showing long a, <br/>\nwaw showing long u, and ya showing long i.<br/>\n<br/>\nArabic does not have the vowels e and o. When Hausa speakers write <br/>\nHausa using ajami, they use the same symbols to write both o and u <br/>\n(both long and short). One must therefore know the words to know <br/>\nwhich vowel, o or u, is intended. Ajami does have a way to <br/>\ndistinguish e from other vowels. A large point or dot under a <br/>\nconsonant shows vocalization with a short e, and that dot, <br/>\nsupplemented with a vertical stroke above the consonant shows <br/>\nvocalization with a long e. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone knows of an adapted Arabic script for Enlish, I would be <br/>\ninterested in looking at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Turks thought so highly of the Arabic writing system that they <br/>\nswitched to an extended Latin alphabet.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve<br/>\n<br/>\nAnimated Arabic Alphabet: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.islamicart.com/main/calligraphy/reform.html\">http://www.islamicart.com/main/calligraphy/reform.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/aflang/Hausa/Pronunciation/writing.\">http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/aflang/Hausa/Pronunciation/writing.</a><br/>\nhtml<br/>\njavascript:reqWin(&#39;/main/calligraphy/catalog/alphabet.html&#39;)</div>",
