This is<br/>\n   not to say that QS can really compete with shorthand for<br/>\n   writing speed -- my guestimate being that full Senior QS<br/>\n   is about as quick as wholly unabbreviated shorthand, which<br/>\n   is still considerably quicker than ordinary longhand --,<br/>\n   but QS reading speed is considerably higher than for<br/>\n   shorthand, especially when reading what someone else has<br/>\n   written, and still the graphic simplification of the QS<br/>\n   letters allows for saving effort and time not only in<br/>\n   writing but also in reading, regardless of who has<br/>\n   written. In fact QS handwriting doesn&#39;t degrade as easily<br/>\n   and quickly nor as much as Latin handwriting, as all who<br/>\n   have written QS know, exactly because it&#39;s graphic shapes<br/>\n   are already optimized and don&#39;t need any further<br/>\n   simplification to save effort.

Mapping of the same shapes<br/>\n   to different sounds in alphabets based no the same<br/>\n   principle is a major annoyance for those who need to<br/>\n   switch between different alphabets, as anyone can testify<br/>\n   who has come from the Latin alphabet to Cyrillic cursive,<br/>\n   where shapes looking like &quot;d g u n p m y r&quot; map to /b d i<br/>\n   p r t u ja/, in comparison to which which mappings like &quot;b<br/>\n   e c&quot; to /v je s/ remain minor annoyances as they at least<br/>\n   remain within the range of similarity to the familiar.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Switching alphabets when switching languages in the same<br/>\n   text may be annoying, especially when reading.
