This<br/>\nversion contains your changes, Moira&#39;s proposal, and a few small<br/>\nchanges to QS-Nu.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne change I made was to adopt your mapping for #21 and the alternate<br/>\nfor #23. It&#39;s a vast improvement in the second case, and only a minor<br/>\nloss (it seems to me) for #21. I should have thought of this myself,<br/>\nsince &#39;g&#39; is used for /N/ in Fijian (one of the languages I&#39;ve<br/>\nstudied).<br/>\n<br/>\nI should have said earlier that in creating a mapping proposal,<br/>\neveryone is encouraged to copy one another!<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion: is the time frame I&#39;ve suggested OK with everyone? If people<br/>\nwould like more time to make proposals, we can move the deadline into<br/>\n2008. December 31 was a completely arbitrary choice on my part. Would<br/>\nsometime in January be better?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nTed<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Dec 20, 2007 6:40 AM, Benct Philip Jonsson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bpj@...\">bpj@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; # Benct Philip Jonsson&#39;s Quikscript key mapping proposals<br/>\n&gt;  (Revised)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ## Revision history:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ### Date: 20.12.2007<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  | | | Jerome | BPJ 2| BPJ 2.1 |<br/>\n&gt;  |------|-------------|-------------|------|-------------|<br/>\n&gt;  | 36 | Utter | a | ` | u |<br/>\n&gt;  | 39 | Foot | U | u * | V * |<br/>\n&gt;  | 36 | Up | u | V * | C * |<br/>\n&gt;  | | naming-dot | / | ^ | ` * |<br/>\n&gt;  | | half-Ye | ^ | C * | ^ |<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ----------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ## Benct Philip Jonsson&#39;s Quikscript key mapping proposal No. 1<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The main innovation in my proposal lies in the<br/>\n&gt;  assignment of vowel letters, where I&#39;ve tried to<br/>\n&gt;  provide memory-cues which work in terms of the inner<br/>\n&gt;  structure of Quikscript itself: I wanted my mapping to<br/>\n&gt;  make sense primarily in terms of the observed<br/>\n&gt;  systematic relations between Quikscript letter-shapes<br/>\n&gt;  and values as assigned by Read, and secondarily by<br/>\n&gt;  recurring relations between Quikscript and Traditional<br/>\n&gt;  Orthography spellings. This mapping is meant to be a<br/>\n&gt;  transcription *of Quikscript* rather than any phonemic<br/>\n&gt;  or phonetic transcription system, which may be<br/>\n&gt;  &#39;external&#39; to Quikscript. When using this mapping one<br/>\n&gt;  will have to think in terms of Quikscript letter-shapes<br/>\n&gt;  and letter-relations. This is meant to be an advantage<br/>\n&gt;  in that one will &#39;think Quikscript&#39; when typing in this<br/>\n&gt;  transcription, which will hopefully be of help both to<br/>\n&gt;  those who are used to write (as opposed to type) in<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript in learning to type with this mapping, and<br/>\n&gt;  to those who are going to learn to write and type<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript simultaneously.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ### List of assignments in BPJ 1<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  (Assignments with a following * differ from Jerome<br/>\n&gt;  kmap, and the half-letters with an * after their name<br/>\n&gt;  are not found in the Quikscript Manual.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  | QS # | (Jerome)| Name | BPJ 1|<br/>\n&gt;  |------|---------|-------------|------|<br/>\n&gt;  | #1 |p | Pea | p |<br/>\n&gt;  | #2 |b | Bay | b |<br/>\n&gt;  | #3 |t | Tea | t |<br/>\n&gt;  | #4 |d | Day | d |<br/>\n&gt;  | #5 |k | Key | k |<br/>\n&gt;  | #6 |g | Gay | g |<br/>\n&gt;  | #7 |T | Thaw | T |<br/>\n&gt;  | #8 |H | They | D * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #9 |f | Fee | f |<br/>\n&gt;  | #10 |v | Vie | v |<br/>\n&gt;  | #11 |s | See | s |<br/>\n&gt;  | #12 |z | Zoo | z |<br/>\n&gt;  | #13 |S | She | S |<br/>\n&gt;  | #14 |Z | J&#39;ai | Z |<br/>\n&gt;  | #15 |c | Cheer | c |<br/>\n&gt;  | #16 |J | Jay | J |<br/>\n&gt;  | #17 |j | Ye | j |<br/>\n&gt;  | #18 |w | Way | w |<br/>\n&gt;  | #19 |h | He | h |<br/>\n&gt;  | #20 |` | Why | W * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #21 |N | Ing | G * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #22 |m | May | m |<br/>\n&gt;  | #23 |n | No | n |<br/>\n&gt;  | #24 |l | Low | l |<br/>\n&gt;  | #25 |r | Roe | r |<br/>\n&gt;  | #26 |i | It | i |<br/>\n&gt;  | #27 |I | Eat | I |<br/>\n&gt;  | #28 |e | Et | e |<br/>\n&gt;  | #29 |E | Eight | E |<br/>\n&gt;  | #30 |A | At | a * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #31 |F | I | A * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #32 |y | Ah | q * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #33 |Y | Awe | Q * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #34 |o | Ox | o |<br/>\n&gt;  | #35 |q | Oy | O * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #36 |a | Utter | y * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #37 |Q | Out | Y * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #38 |O | Owe | B * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #39 |U | Foot | u * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #40 |M | Ooze | U * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #41 |\u00e7 | Loch | K * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #42 |\u00e6 | Llan | L * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #43 |\u00e8 | Excite | x * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #44 |\u00e9 | Exam | X * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #23 |G | Noon | N * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #36 |u | Up | V * |<br/>\n&gt;  | - |/ | naming dot | ` * |<br/>\n&gt;  | - | | left bracket| ( |<br/>\n&gt;  | - | |right bracket| ) |<br/>\n&gt;  | #1.5 |] | half-Pea | P * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #3.5 |[ | half-Tea | F * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #4.5 |B | half-Day | R * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #12.5|L | half-Zoo | C * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #17.5|^ | half-Ye * | ^ |<br/>\n&gt;  | #18.5|@ | half-Way | M * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #19.5| &#92;&#92; | half-He | H * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #20.5|~ | half-Why * | ~ |<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ### &#39;Paired&#39; vowel-letter assignments<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Of the fifteen Quikscript vowel-letters fourteen form<br/>\n&gt;  pairs of related shapes, and Read clearly endeavored to<br/>\n&gt;  assign related sounds to the letters within each pair.<br/>\n&gt;  The six &#39;lax&#39; vowel phonemes of RP English have each<br/>\n&gt;  been assigned a letter within one of these pairs -- the<br/>\n&gt;  one without an extra loop in in the four cases where<br/>\n&gt;  the difference between the paired letters consists of<br/>\n&gt;  such a loop --, while the other letter of each pair has<br/>\n&gt;  been assigned to a similar-sounding &#39;tense&#39; vowel or<br/>\n&gt;  diphthong. Five of the six RP &#39;lax&#39; vowel phonemes are<br/>\n&gt;  readily associated with five of the six vowel-letters<br/>\n&gt;  of Traditional Orthography, and thus the Quikscript<br/>\n&gt;  letters for those phonemes have been mapped to the<br/>\n&gt;  lower-case forms of their associated Traditional<br/>\n&gt;  Orthography letters: #26 = `{i}`, #28 = `{e}`, #30 =<br/>\n&gt;  `{a}`, #34 = `{o}`, #39 = `{u}`, and the sixth RP &#39;lax&#39;<br/>\n&gt;  vowel phoneme /&#x028C;/, and its Quikscript letter #36 --<br/>\n&gt;  which is paired with a &#39;looped&#39; letter #37 -- has been<br/>\n&gt;  mapped to the sixth Traditional Orthography vowel<br/>\n&gt;  letter `{y}`.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Next we assign the Quikscript letters which are paired<br/>\n&gt;  with the Quikscript letters for the &#39;lax&#39; vowels to the<br/>\n&gt;  corresponding Traditional Orthography upper-case vowel-<br/>\n&gt;  letters. Some of these mappings make no &#39;phonetic&#39;<br/>\n&gt;  sense; rather one has to remember the mapping of lower-<br/>\n&gt;  case Traditional Orthography vowel-letters to<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript letters, and then the rule that the<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript letters paired with these letters are<br/>\n&gt;  assigned to the corresponding Traditional Orthography<br/>\n&gt;  upper-case letters: #27 = `{I}`, #29 = `{E}`, #31 =<br/>\n&gt;  `{I}`, #35 = `{O}`, #37 = `{Y}`, #40 = `{U}`.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ### Some problematic assignments<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  We then come to the seventh Quikscript vowel letter<br/>\n&gt;  pair #32-#33. They are problematic, since there are no<br/>\n&gt;  Traditional Orthography vowel letters readily available<br/>\n&gt;  for them. I choose to assign them to the one<br/>\n&gt;  Traditional Orthography upper-lower-case letter-pair<br/>\n&gt;  not readily associated with any English phoneme, namely<br/>\n&gt;  `{Q}`-`{q}`. This does not mean that there are no<br/>\n&gt;  memory-cues available for these mappings: Quikscript<br/>\n&gt;  letter #33 can be seen as a shape variation of<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript letter #34, and the Traditional Orthography<br/>\n&gt;  upper-case __Q__ is of course visually similar to a<br/>\n&gt;  Traditional Orthography upper-case __O__, and, likewise<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript letter #32 can be seen as a shape variation<br/>\n&gt;  of Quikscript letter #30, and Traditional Orthography<br/>\n&gt;  lower-case __q__ is -- admittedly vaguely -- similar to a<br/>\n&gt;  Traditional Orthography lower-case script __a__.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Last we come the unpaired Quikscript vowel-letter #38.<br/>\n&gt;  It&#39;s sound is usually associated with the Traditional<br/>\n&gt;  Orthography letter __o__, or one of the digraphs __oa, ou__<br/>\n&gt;  or __ow__ which all contain __o__, but due to my choosen<br/>\n&gt;  system for assigning the &#39;paired&#39; Quikscript vowel-<br/>\n&gt;  letters to ASCII letters `{o}` and `{O}` are already<br/>\n&gt;  occupied by Quikscript letters #34-#35. Quikscript<br/>\n&gt;  letter #38 must therefore be assigned to the otherwise<br/>\n&gt;  unused Traditional Orthography upper-case letter __B__,<br/>\n&gt;  which at least allows us to use the words &quot;bowl&quot; and<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;bow&quot; (the noun), which recall the shape of the letter<br/>\n&gt;  in the Quikscript Manual, as memory-cues. I readily<br/>\n&gt;  admit, however that this is the weakest point of my<br/>\n&gt;  proposal: if one finds the system for assigning the<br/>\n&gt;  other vowels an advantage in favor of my proposal one<br/>\n&gt;  will simply have to take this weakness in the bargain!<br/>\n&gt;  It was tempting to assign Quikscript letter #38 to the<br/>\n&gt;  ASCII `@` symbol, but I preferred to assign all the<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript letters which are sanctioned by the<br/>\n&gt;  Quikscript Manual to Traditional Orthography upper- or<br/>\n&gt;  lower-case letters leaving the ASCII symbol characters<br/>\n&gt;  alone, and the namer dot to the &#39;back-tick&#39; `{&#92;`}`<br/>\n&gt;  which is superfluous in normal typing, pace TeX.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ### Consonants<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  There are few innovations among the primary consonants,<br/>\n&gt;  since the majority of Quikscript consonant-letters have an<br/>\n&gt;  obvious one-to-one counterpart in Traditional Orthography.<br/>\n&gt;  Most of the remaining Quikscript consonant-letters have been<br/>\n&gt;  assigned them to the upper- case version of the letters for<br/>\n&gt;  the most similar sounds already assigned to a lower-case<br/>\n&gt;  letter, and I think few will argue against the assignments<br/>\n&gt;  #7 = `{T}`, #8 = `{D}`, #13 = `{S}`, #14 = `{Z}`, nor with<br/>\n&gt;  the assignment of #15 to lower-case `{c}`, where the added<br/>\n&gt;  complication of having to press the shift key seemed<br/>\n&gt;  unwarranted, despite the apparent regularity of upper- case<br/>\n&gt;  corresponding to an added __h__ in Traditional Orthography.<br/>\n&gt;  One might have preferred mapping Quikscript letter #13 to<br/>\n&gt;  ASCII upper- case `{C}` and Quikscript letter #14 to ASCII<br/>\n&gt;  upper-case `{J}`, but the system of vowel- assignments has<br/>\n&gt;  already preempted the pair `{y}`-`{Y}` for use as vowels, so<br/>\n&gt;  that ASCII lower-case `{j}` had to be assigned to Quikscript<br/>\n&gt;  letter #17, making it necessary to assign Quikscript letter<br/>\n&gt;  #16 to ASCII upper-case `{J}`, in spite of this being a step<br/>\n&gt;  away from native speakers&#39; and writer&#39;s intuitions about<br/>\n&gt;  Traditional Orthography letter-to-sound correspondances. At<br/>\n&gt;  least it agrees with the old Quikscript font mapping.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The reassignment -- in fact swapping -- of the<br/>\n&gt;  assignments of `{G}` and `{N}` may be a cause for concern<br/>\n&gt;  for those used to &#39;traditional&#39; Quikscript fonts, but I<br/>\n&gt;  think it is warranted: the Traditional Orthography<br/>\n&gt;  spelling __ng__ at least contains a __g__, while words like<br/>\n&gt;  __now, knack, knife, need__ -- the the Quikscript Manual<br/>\n&gt;  examples of initial alternate #23 -- don&#39;t, making<br/>\n&gt;  transcriptions like `{loGiG, NY, Nak, NAf, NId}` more<br/>\n&gt;  readibly recognizable than `{loNiN, GY, Gak, GAf,<br/>\n&gt;  GId}`. I&#39;m prepared to back down on this point,<br/>\n&gt;  however.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ## Benct Philip Jonsson&#39;s Quikscript key mapping<br/>\n&gt;  proposal No. 2<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I have been considering a different arrangement which<br/>\n&gt;  would allow the assignment of Quikscript letter #17 to<br/>\n&gt;  ASCII lower-case `{y}` and other differences which<br/>\n&gt;  would allow memory-cues which are perhaps more<br/>\n&gt;  intuitive in terms of native speakers&#39; and writers&#39;<br/>\n&gt;  expectations of Traditional Orthography sound-to-letter<br/>\n&gt;  correspondences, including the well-nigh universal<br/>\n&gt;  inclination to map Quikscript letter #36 to lower-case<br/>\n&gt;  `{u}`. Alas upper-case `{B}` would still be assigned to a<br/>\n&gt;  vowel, and now memory-cued to the word &quot;bout&quot;, and<br/>\n&gt;  probably those who are familiar with the __&#x0223;__<br/>\n&gt;  ligature form of the __ou__ digraph will be aided by its<br/>\n&gt;  visual similarity to upper-case __B__.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ### Assignments which differ between BPJ 1 and BPJ 2.1<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  | QS # | (Jerome)| Name | BPJ 1| BPJ 2.1 |<br/>\n&gt;  |------|---------|-------------|------|-------------|<br/>\n&gt;  | #14 |Z | J&#39;ai | Z | J * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #16 |J | Jay | J | j * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #17 |j | Ye | j | y * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #31 |F | I | A * | Y * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #32 |y | Ah | q * | A * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #35 |q | Oy | O * | q |<br/>\n&gt;  | #36 |a | Utter | y * | u * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #37 |Q | Out | Y * | B * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #39 |U | Foot | u * | V * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #38 |O | Owe | B * | O |<br/>\n&gt;  | #36 |u | Up | V * | C * |<br/>\n&gt;  | #12.5|L | half-Zoo | C * | Z * |<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  These changes do in fact amount to a different<br/>\n&gt;  proposal, since it no longer includes the &#39;Quikscript-<br/>\n&gt;  internal&#39; &#39;paired&#39; vowel-letter assignments.

If people\nwould like more time to make proposals, we can move the d=\r\neadline into\n2008. December 31 was a completely arbitrary choice on my part=\r\n.

Five of the six RP &#39;lax&#39; vowel phonemes are=\r\n\n&gt;  readily associated with five of the six vowel-letters\n&gt;  of Traditional=\r\n Orthography, and thus the Quikscript\n&gt;  letters for those phonemes have be=\r\nen mapped to the\n&gt;  lower-case forms of their associated Traditional\n&gt;  Ort=\r\nhography letters: #26 =3D `{i}`, #28 =3D `{e}`, #30 =3D\n&gt;  `{a}`, #34 =3D `=\r\n{o}`, #39 =3D `{u}`, and the sixth RP &#39;lax&#39;\n&gt;  vowel phoneme /&#x028C;/, an=\r\nd its Quikscript letter #36 --\n&gt;  which is paired with a &#39;looped&#39; letter #3=\r\n7 -- has been\n&gt;  mapped to the sixth Traditional Orthography vowel\n&gt;  lette=\r\nr `{y}`.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Next we assign the Quikscript letters which are paired\n&gt;  wit=\r\nh the Quikscript letters for the &#39;lax&#39; vowels to the\n&gt;  corresponding Tradi=\r\ntional Orthography upper-case vowel-\n&gt;  letters. Some of these mappings mak=\r\ne no &#39;phonetic&#39;\n&gt;  sense; rather one has to remember the mapping of lower-\n=\r\n&gt;  case Traditional Orthography vowel-letters to\n&gt;  Quikscript letters, and=\r\n then the rule that the\n&gt;  Quikscript letters paired with these letters are=\r\n\n&gt;  assigned to the corresponding Traditional Orthography\n&gt;  upper-case let=\r\nters: #27 =3D `{I}`, #29 =3D `{E}`, #31 =3D\n&gt;  `{I}`, #35 =3D `{O}`, #37 =\r\n=3D `{Y}`, #40 =3D `{U}`.\n&gt;\n&gt;  ### Some problematic assignments\n&gt;\n&gt;  We the=\r\nn come to the seventh Quikscript vowel letter\n&gt;  pair #32-#33. They are pro=\r\nblematic, since there are no\n&gt;  Traditional Orthography vowel letters readi=\r\nly available\n&gt;  for them. I choose to assign them to the one\n&gt;  Traditional=\r\n Orthography upper-lower-case letter-pair\n&gt;  not readily associated with an=\r\ny English phoneme, namely\n&gt;  `{Q}`-`{q}`. This does not mean that there are=\r\n no\n&gt;  memory-cues available for these mappings: Quikscript\n&gt;  letter #33 c=\r\nan be seen as a shape variation of\n&gt;  Quikscript letter #34, and the Tradit=\r\nional Orthography\n&gt;  upper-case __Q__ is of course visually similar to a\n&gt; =\r\n Traditional Orthography upper-case __O__, and, likewise\n&gt;  Quikscript lett=\r\ner #32 can be seen as a shape variation\n&gt;  of Quikscript letter #30, and Tr=\r\naditional Orthography\n&gt;  lower-case __q__ is -- admittedly vaguely -- simil=\r\nar to a\n&gt;  Traditional Orthography lower-case script __a__.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Last we co=\r\nme the unpaired Quikscript vowel-letter #38.\n&gt;  It&#39;s sound is usually assoc=\r\niated with the Traditional\n&gt;  Orthography letter __o__, or one of the digra=\r\nphs __oa, ou__\n&gt;  or __ow__ which all contain __o__, but due to my choosen\n=\r\n&gt;  system for assigning the &#39;paired&#39; Quikscript vowel-\n&gt;  letters to ASCII =\r\nletters `{o}` and `{O}` are already\n&gt;  occupied by Quikscript letters #34-#=\r\n35. Quikscript\n&gt;  letter #38 must therefore be assigned to the otherwise\n&gt; =\r\n unused Traditional Orthography upper-case letter __B__,\n&gt;  which at least =\r\nallows us to use the words &quot;bowl&quot; and\n&gt;  &quot;bow&quot; (the noun), which recall the=\r\n shape of the letter\n&gt;  in the Quikscript Manual, as memory-cues. I readily=\r\n\n&gt;  admit, however that this is the weakest point of my\n&gt;  proposal: if one=\r\n finds the system for assigning the\n&gt;  other vowels an advantage in favor o=\r\nf my proposal one\n&gt;  will simply have to take this weakness in the bargain!=\r\n\n&gt;  It was tempting to assign Quikscript letter #38 to the\n&gt;  ASCII `@` sym=\r\nbol, but I preferred to assign all the\n&gt;  Quikscript letters which are sanc=\r\ntioned by the\n&gt;  Quikscript Manual to Traditional Orthography upper- or\n&gt;  =\r\nlower-case letters leaving the ASCII symbol characters\n&gt;  alone, and the na=\r\nmer dot to the &#39;back-tick&#39; `{&#92;`}`\n&gt;  which is superfluous in normal typing,=\r\n pace TeX.\n&gt;\n&gt;  ### Consonants\n&gt;\n&gt;  There are few innovations among the pri=\r\nmary consonants,\n&gt;  since the majority of Quikscript consonant-letters have=\r\n an\n&gt;  obvious one-to-one counterpart in Traditional Orthography.\n&gt;  Most o=\r\nf the remaining Quikscript consonant-letters have been\n&gt;  assigned them to =\r\nthe upper- case version of the letters for\n&gt;  the most similar sounds alrea=\r\ndy assigned to a lower-case\n&gt;  letter, and I think few will argue against t=\r\nhe assignments\n&gt;  #7 =3D `{T}`, #8 =3D `{D}`, #13 =3D `{S}`, #14 =3D `{Z}`,=\r\n nor with\n&gt;  the assignment of #15 to lower-case `{c}`, where the added\n&gt;  =\r\ncomplication of having to press the shift key seemed\n&gt;  unwarranted, despit=\r\ne the apparent regularity of upper- case\n&gt;  corresponding to an added __h__=\r\n in Traditional Orthography.\n&gt;  One might have preferred mapping Quikscript=\r\n letter #13 to\n&gt;  ASCII upper- case `{C}` and Quikscript letter #14 to ASCI=\r\nI\n&gt;  upper-case `{J}`, but the system of vowel- assignments has\n&gt;  already =\r\npreempted the pair `{y}`-`{Y}` for use as vowels, so\n&gt;  that ASCII lower-ca=\r\nse `{j}` had to be assigned to Quikscript\n&gt;  letter #17, making it necessar=\r\ny to assign Quikscript letter\n&gt;  #16 to ASCII upper-case `{J}`, in spite of=\r\n this being a step\n&gt;  away from native speakers&#39; and writer&#39;s intuitions ab=\r\nout\n&gt;  Traditional Orthography letter-to-sound correspondances. At\n&gt;  least=\r\n it agrees with the old Quikscript font mapping.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The reassignment -- i=\r\nn fact swapping -- of the\n&gt;  assignments of `{G}` and `{N}` may be a cause =\r\nfor concern\n&gt;  for those used to &#39;traditional&#39; Quikscript fonts, but I\n&gt;  t=\r\nhink it is warranted: the Traditional Orthography\n&gt;  spelling __ng__ at lea=\r\nst contains a __g__, while words like\n&gt;  __now, knack, knife, need__ -- the=\r\n the Quikscript Manual\n&gt;  examples of initial alternate #23 -- don&#39;t, makin=\r\ng\n&gt;  transcriptions like `{loGiG, NY, Nak, NAf, NId}` more\n&gt;  readibly reco=\r\ngnizable than `{loNiN, GY, Gak, GAf,\n&gt;  GId}`. I&#39;m prepared to back down on=\r\n this point,\n&gt;  however.\n&gt;\n&gt;  ## Benct Philip Jonsson&#39;s Quikscript key mapp=\r\ning\n&gt;  proposal No. 2\n&gt;\n&gt;  I have been considering a different arrangement =\r\nwhich\n&gt;  would allow the assignment of Quikscript letter #17 to\n&gt;  ASCII lo=\r\nwer-case `{y}` and other differences which\n&gt;  would allow memory-cues which=\r\n are perhaps more\n&gt;  intuitive in terms of native speakers&#39; and writers&#39;\n&gt; =\r\n expectations of Traditional Orthography sound-to-letter\n&gt;  correspondences=\r\n, including the well-nigh universal\n&gt;  inclination to map Quikscript letter=\r\n #36 to lower-case\n&gt;  `{u}`. Alas upper-case `{B}` would still be assigned =\r\nto a\n&gt;  vowel, and now memory-cued to the word &quot;bout&quot;, and\n&gt;  probably thos=\r\ne who are familiar with the __&#x0223;__\n&gt;  ligature form of the __ou__ dig=\r\nraph will be aided by its\n&gt;  visual similarity to upper-case __B__.\n&gt;\n&gt;  ##=\r\n# Assignments which differ between BPJ 1 and BPJ 2.1\n&gt;\n&gt;  | QS # | (Jerome)=\r\n| Name | BPJ 1| BPJ 2.1 |\n&gt;  |------|---------|-------------|------|-------=\r\n------|\n&gt;  | #14 |Z | J&#39;ai | Z | J * |\n&gt;  | #16 |J | Jay | J | j * |\n&gt;  | #=\r\n17 |j | Ye | j | y * |\n&gt;  | #31 |F | I | A * | Y * |\n&gt;  | #32 |y | Ah | q *=\r\n | A * |\n&gt;  | #35 |q | Oy | O * | q |\n&gt;  | #36 |a | Utter | y * | u * |\n&gt;  =\r\n| #37 |Q | Out | Y * | B * |\n&gt;  | #39 |U | Foot | u * | V * |\n&gt;  | #38 |O |=\r\n Owe | B * | O |\n&gt;  | #36 |u | Up | V * | C * |\n&gt;  | #12.5|L | half-Zoo | C=\r\n * | Z * |\n&gt;\n&gt;  These changes do in fact amount to a different\n&gt;  proposal,=\r\n since it no longer includes the &#39;Quikscript-\n&gt;  internal&#39; &#39;paired&#39; vowel-l=\r\netter assignments.
