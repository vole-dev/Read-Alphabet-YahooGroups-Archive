This mapping is meant to be a<br/>\ntranscription *of Quikscript* rather than any phonemic<br/>\nor phonetic transcription system, which may be<br/>\n&#39;external&#39; to Quikscript. When using this mapping one<br/>\nwill have to think in terms of Quikscript letter-shapes<br/>\nand letter-relations. This is meant to be an advantage<br/>\nin that one will &#39;think Quikscript&#39; when typing in this<br/>\ntranscription, which will hopefully be of help both to<br/>\nthose who are used to write (as opposed to type) in<br/>\nQuikscript in learning to type with this mapping, and<br/>\nto those who are going to learn to write and type<br/>\nQuikscript simultaneously.<br/>\n<br/>\n### List of assignments in BPJ 1<br/>\n<br/>\n(Assignments with a following * differ from Jerome<br/>\nkmap, and the half-letters with an * after their name<br/>\nare not found in the Quikscript Manual.)<br/>\n<br/>\n| QS # | (Jerome)| Name        | BPJ 1|<br/>\n|------|---------|-------------|------|<br/>\n| #1   |p        | Pea         | p    |<br/>\n| #2   |b        | Bay         | b    |<br/>\n| #3   |t        | Tea         | t    |<br/>\n| #4   |d        | Day         | d    |<br/>\n| #5   |k        | Key         | k    |<br/>\n| #6   |g        | Gay         | g    |<br/>\n| #7   |T        | Thaw        | T    |<br/>\n| #8   |H        | They        | D *  |<br/>\n| #9   |f        | Fee         | f    |<br/>\n| #10  |v        | Vie         | v    |<br/>\n| #11  |s        | See         | s    |<br/>\n| #12  |z        | Zoo         | z    |<br/>\n| #13  |S        | She         | S    |<br/>\n| #14  |Z        | J&#39;ai        | Z    |<br/>\n| #15  |c        | Cheer       | c    |<br/>\n| #16  |J        | Jay         | J    |<br/>\n| #17  |j        | Ye          | j    |<br/>\n| #18  |w        | Way         | w    |<br/>\n| #19  |h        | He          | h    |<br/>\n| #20  |`        | Why         | W *  |<br/>\n| #21  |N        | Ing         | G *  |<br/>\n| #22  |m        | May         | m    |<br/>\n| #23  |n        | No          | n    |<br/>\n| #24  |l        | Low         | l    |<br/>\n| #25  |r        | Roe         | r    |<br/>\n| #26  |i        | It          | i    |<br/>\n| #27  |I        | Eat         | I    |<br/>\n| #28  |e        | Et          | e    |<br/>\n| #29  |E        | Eight       | E    |<br/>\n| #30  |A        | At          | a *  |<br/>\n| #31  |F        | I           | A *  |<br/>\n| #32  |y        | Ah          | q *  |<br/>\n| #33  |Y        | Awe         | Q *  |<br/>\n| #34  |o        | Ox          | o    |<br/>\n| #35  |q        | Oy          | O *  |<br/>\n| #36  |a        | Utter       | y *  |<br/>\n| #37  |Q        | Out         | Y *  |<br/>\n| #38  |O        | Owe         | B *  |<br/>\n| #39  |U        | Foot        | u *  |<br/>\n| #40  |M        | Ooze        | U *  |<br/>\n| #41  |\u00e7        | Loch        | K *  |<br/>\n| #42  |\u00e6        | Llan        | L *  |<br/>\n| #43  |\u00e8        | Excite      | x *  |<br/>\n| #44  |\u00e9        | Exam        | X *  |<br/>\n| #23  |G        | Noon        | N *  |<br/>\n| #36  |u        | Up          | V *  |<br/>\n| -    |/        | naming dot  | ` *  |<br/>\n| -    |         | left bracket| (    |<br/>\n| -    |         |right bracket| )    |<br/>\n| #1.5 |]        | half-Pea    | P *  |<br/>\n| #3.5 |[        | half-Tea    | F *  |<br/>\n| #4.5 |B        | half-Day    | R *  |<br/>\n| #12.5|L        | half-Zoo    | C *  |<br/>\n| #17.5|^        | half-Ye *   | ^    |<br/>\n| #18.5|@        | half-Way    | M *  |<br/>\n| #19.5| &#92;&#92;      | half-He     | H *  |<br/>\n| #20.5|~        | half-Why *  | ~    |<br/>\n<br/>\n### &#39;Paired&#39; vowel-letter assignments<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the fifteen Quikscript vowel-letters fourteen form<br/>\npairs of related shapes, and Read clearly endeavored to<br/>\nassign related sounds to the letters within each pair.<br/>\nThe six &#39;lax&#39; vowel phonemes of RP English have each<br/>\nbeen assigned a letter within one of these pairs -- the<br/>\none without an extra loop in in the four cases where<br/>\nthe difference between the paired letters consists of<br/>\nsuch a loop --, while the other letter of each pair has<br/>\nbeen assigned to a similar-sounding &#39;tense&#39; vowel or<br/>\ndiphthong. Five of the six RP &#39;lax&#39; vowel phonemes are<br/>\nreadily associated with five of the six vowel-letters<br/>\nof Traditional Orthography, and thus the Quikscript<br/>\nletters for those phonemes have been mapped to the<br/>\nlower-case forms of their associated Traditional<br/>\nOrthography letters: #26 = `{i}`, #28 = `{e}`, #30 =<br/>\n`{a}`, #34 = `{o}`, #39 = `{u}`, and the sixth RP &#39;lax&#39;<br/>\nvowel phoneme /&#x028C;/, and its Quikscript letter #36 --<br/>\nwhich is paired with a &#39;looped&#39; letter #37 -- has been<br/>\nmapped to the sixth Traditional Orthography vowel<br/>\nletter `{y}`.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext we assign the Quikscript letters which are paired<br/>\nwith the Quikscript letters for the &#39;lax&#39; vowels to the<br/>\ncorresponding Traditional Orthography upper-case vowel-<br/>\nletters. Some of these mappings make no &#39;phonetic&#39;<br/>\nsense; rather one has to remember the mapping of lower-<br/>\ncase Traditional Orthography vowel-letters to<br/>\nQuikscript letters, and then the rule that the<br/>\nQuikscript letters paired with these letters are<br/>\nassigned to the corresponding Traditional Orthography<br/>\nupper-case letters: #27 = `{I}`, #29 = `{E}`, #31 =<br/>\n`{I}`, #35 = `{O}`, #37 = `{Y}`, #40 = `{U}`.<br/>\n<br/>\n### Some problematic assignments<br/>\n<br/>\nWe then come to the seventh Quikscript vowel letter<br/>\npair #32-#33. They are problematic, since there are no<br/>\nTraditional Orthography vowel letters readily available<br/>\nfor them. I choose to assign them to the one<br/>\nTraditional Orthography upper-lower-case letter-pair<br/>\nnot readily associated with any English phoneme, namely<br/>\n`{Q}`-`{q}`. This does not mean that there are no<br/>\nmemory-cues available for these mappings: Quikscript<br/>\nletter #33 can be seen as a shape variation of<br/>\nQuikscript letter #34, and the Traditional Orthography<br/>\nupper-case __Q__ is of course visually similar to a<br/>\nTraditional Orthography upper-case __O__, and, likewise<br/>\nQuikscript letter #32 can be seen as a shape variation<br/>\nof Quikscript letter #30, and Traditional Orthography<br/>\nlower-case __q__ is -- admittedly vaguely -- similar to a<br/>\nTraditional Orthography lower-case script __a__.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast we come the unpaired Quikscript vowel-letter #38.<br/>\nIt&#39;s sound is usually associated with the Traditional<br/>\nOrthography letter __o__, or one of the digraphs __oa, ou__<br/>\nor __ow__ which all contain __o__, but due to my choosen<br/>\nsystem for assigning the &#39;paired&#39; Quikscript vowel-<br/>\nletters to ASCII letters `{o}` and `{O}` are already<br/>\noccupied by Quikscript letters #34-#35. Quikscript<br/>\nletter #38 must therefore be assigned to the otherwise<br/>\nunused Traditional Orthography upper-case letter __B__,<br/>\nwhich at least allows us to use the words &quot;bowl&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;bow&quot; (the noun), which recall the shape of the letter<br/>\nin the Quikscript Manual, as memory-cues. I readily<br/>\nadmit, however that this is the weakest point of my<br/>\nproposal: if one finds the system for assigning the<br/>\nother vowels an advantage in favor of my proposal one<br/>\nwill simply have to take this weakness in the bargain!<br/>\nIt was tempting to assign Quikscript letter #38 to the<br/>\nASCII `@` symbol, but I preferred to assign all the<br/>\nQuikscript letters which are sanctioned by the<br/>\nQuikscript Manual to Traditional Orthography upper- or<br/>\nlower-case letters leaving the ASCII symbol characters<br/>\nalone, and the namer dot to the &#39;back-tick&#39; `{&#92;`}`<br/>\nwhich is superfluous in normal typing, pace TeX.<br/>\n<br/>\n### Consonants<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are few innovations among the primary consonants,<br/>\nsince the majority of Quikscript consonant-letters have an<br/>\nobvious one-to-one counterpart in Traditional Orthography.<br/>\nMost of the remaining Quikscript consonant-letters have been<br/>\nassigned them to the upper- case version of the letters for<br/>\nthe most similar sounds already assigned to a lower-case<br/>\nletter, and I think few will argue against the assignments<br/>\n#7 = `{T}`, #8 = `{D}`, #13 = `{S}`, #14 = `{Z}`, nor with<br/>\nthe assignment of #15 to lower-case `{c}`, where the added<br/>\ncomplication of having to press the shift key seemed<br/>\nunwarranted, despite the apparent regularity of upper- case<br/>\ncorresponding to an added __h__ in Traditional Orthography.<br/>\nOne might have preferred mapping Quikscript letter #13 to<br/>\nASCII upper- case `{C}` and Quikscript letter #14 to ASCII<br/>\nupper-case `{J}`, but the system of vowel- assignments has<br/>\nalready preempted the pair `{y}`-`{Y}` for use as vowels, so<br/>\nthat ASCII lower-case `{j}` had to be assigned to Quikscript<br/>\nletter #17, making it necessary to assign Quikscript letter<br/>\n#16 to ASCII upper-case `{J}`, in spite of this being a step<br/>\naway from native speakers&#39; and writer&#39;s intuitions about<br/>\nTraditional Orthography letter-to-sound correspondances. At<br/>\nleast it agrees with the old Quikscript font mapping.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reassignment -- in fact swapping -- of the<br/>\nassignments of `{G}` and `{N}` may be a cause for concern<br/>\nfor those used to &#39;traditional&#39; Quikscript fonts, but I<br/>\nthink it is warranted: the Traditional Orthography<br/>\nspelling __ng__ at least contains a __g__, while words like<br/>\n__now, knack, knife, need__ -- the the Quikscript Manual<br/>\nexamples of initial alternate #23 -- don&#39;t, making<br/>\ntranscriptions like `{loGiG, NY, Nak, NAf, NId}` more<br/>\nreadibly recognizable than `{loNiN, GY, Gak, GAf,<br/>\nGId}`. I&#39;m prepared to back down on this point,<br/>\nhowever.<br/>\n<br/>\n## Benct Philip Jonsson&#39;s Quikscript key mapping<br/>\nproposal No. 2<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been considering a different arrangement which<br/>\nwould allow the assignment of Quikscript letter #17 to<br/>\nASCII lower-case `{y}` and other differences which<br/>\nwould allow memory-cues which are perhaps more<br/>\nintuitive in terms of native speakers&#39; and writers&#39;<br/>\nexpectations of Traditional Orthography sound-to-letter<br/>\ncorrespondences, including the well-nigh universal<br/>\ninclination to map Quikscript letter #36 to lower-case<br/>\n`{u}`. Alas upper-case `{B}` would still be assigned to a<br/>\nvowel, and now memory-cued to the word &quot;bout&quot;, and<br/>\nprobably those who are familiar with the __&#x0223;__<br/>\nligature form of the __ou__ digraph will be aided by its<br/>\nvisual similarity to upper-case __B__.<br/>\n<br/>\n### Assignments which differ between BPJ 1 and BPJ 2.1<br/>\n<br/>\n| QS # | (Jerome)| Name        | BPJ 1| BPJ 2.1     |<br/>\n|------|---------|-------------|------|-------------|<br/>\n| #14  |Z        | J&#39;ai        | Z    | J *         |<br/>\n| #16  |J        | Jay         | J    | j *         |<br/>\n| #17  |j        | Ye          | j    | y *         |<br/>\n| #31  |F        | I           | A *  | Y *         |<br/>\n| #32  |y        | Ah          | q *  | A *         |<br/>\n| #35  |q        | Oy          | O *  | q           |<br/>\n| #36  |a        | Utter       | y *  | u *         |<br/>\n| #37  |Q        | Out         | Y *  | B *         |<br/>\n| #39  |U        | Foot        | u *  | V *         |<br/>\n| #38  |O        | Owe         | B *  | O           |<br/>\n| #36  |u        | Up          | V *  | C *         |<br/>\n| #12.5|L        | half-Zoo    | C *  | Z *         |<br/>\n<br/>\nThese changes do in fact amount to a different<br/>\nproposal, since it no longer includes the &#39;Quikscript-<br/>\ninternal&#39; &#39;paired&#39; vowel-letter assignments.

This mapping is meant to be a\ntranscription *of Quikscript* rather than any phonemic\nor phonetic transcription system, which may be\n&#39;external&#39; to Quikscript. When using this mapping one\nwill have to think in terms of Quikscript letter-shapes\nand letter-relations. This is meant to be an advantage\nin that one will &#39;think Quikscript&#39; when typing in this\ntranscription, which will hopefully be of help both to\nthose who are used to write (as opposed to type) in\nQuikscript in learning to type with this mapping, and\nto those who are going to learn to write and type\nQuikscript simultaneously.\n\n### List of assignments in BPJ 1\n\n(Assignments with a following * differ from Jerome\nkmap, and the half-letters with an * after their name\nare not found in the Quikscript Manual.)\n\n| QS # | (Jerome)| Name        | BPJ 1|\n|------|---------|-------------|------|\n| #1   |p        | Pea         | p    |\n| #2   |b        | Bay         | b    |\n| #3   |t        | Tea         | t    |\n| #4   |d        | Day         | d    |\n| #5   |k        | Key         | k    |\n| #6   |g        | Gay         | g    |\n| #7   |T        | Thaw        | T    |\n| #8   |H        | They        | D *  |\n| #9   |f        | Fee         | f    |\n| #10  |v        | Vie         | v    |\n| #11  |s        | See         | s    |\n| #12  |z        | Zoo         | z    |\n| #13  |S        | She         | S    |\n| #14  |Z        | J&#39;ai        | Z    |\n| #15  |c        | Cheer       | c    |\n| #16  |J        | Jay         | J    |\n| #17  |j        | Ye          | j    |\n| #18  |w        | Way         | w    |\n| #19  |h        | He          | h    |\n| #20  |`        | Why         | W *  |\n| #21  |N        | Ing         | G *  |\n| #22  |m        | May         | m    |\n| #23  |n        | No          | n    |\n| #24  |l        | Low         | l    |\n| #25  |r        | Roe         | r    |\n| #26  |i        | It          | i    |\n| #27  |I        | Eat         | I    |\n| #28  |e        | Et          | e    |\n| #29  |E        | Eight       | E    |\n| #30  |A        | At          | a *  |\n| #31  |F        | I           | A *  |\n| #32  |y        | Ah          | q *  |\n| #33  |Y        | Awe         | Q *  |\n| #34  |o        | Ox          | o    |\n| #35  |q        | Oy          | O *  |\n| #36  |a        | Utter       | y *  |\n| #37  |Q        | Out         | Y *  |\n| #38  |O        | Owe         | B *  |\n| #39  |U        | Foot        | u *  |\n| #40  |M        | Ooze        | U *  |\n| #41  |\u00e7        | Loch        | K *  |\n| #42  |\u00e6        | Llan        | L *  |\n| #43  |\u00e8        | Excite      | x *  |\n| #44  |\u00e9        | Exam        | X *  |\n| #23  |G        | Noon        | N *  |\n| #36  |u        | Up          | V *  |\n| -    |/        | naming dot  | ` *  |\n| -    |         | left bracket| (    |\n| -    |         |right bracket| )    |\n| #1.5 |]        | half-Pea    | P *  |\n| #3.5 |[        | half-Tea    | F *  |\n| #4.5 |B        | half-Day    | R *  |\n| #12.5|L        | half-Zoo    | C *  |\n| #17.5|^        | half-Ye *   | ^    |\n| #18.5|@        | half-Way    | M *  |\n| #19.5| &#92;&#92;      | half-He     | H *  |\n| #20.5|~        | half-Why *  | ~    |\n\n### &#39;Paired&#39; vowel-letter assignments\n\nOf the fifteen Quikscript vowel-letters fourteen form\npairs of related shapes, and Read clearly endeavored to\nassign related sounds to the letters within each pair.\nThe six &#39;lax&#39; vowel phonemes of RP English have each\nbeen assigned a letter within one of these pairs -- the\none without an extra loop in in the four cases where\nthe difference between the paired letters consists of\nsuch a loop --, while the other letter of each pair has\nbeen assigned to a similar-sounding &#39;tense&#39; vowel or\ndiphthong. Five of the six RP &#39;lax&#39; vowel phonemes are\nreadily associated with five of the six vowel-letters\nof Traditional Orthography, and thus the Quikscript\nletters for those phonemes have been mapped to the\nlower-case forms of their associated Traditional\nOrthography letters: #26 = `{i}`, #28 = `{e}`, #30 =\n`{a}`, #34 = `{o}`, #39 = `{u}`, and the sixth RP &#39;lax&#39;\nvowel phoneme /&#x028C;/, and its Quikscript letter #36 --\nwhich is paired with a &#39;looped&#39; letter #37 -- has been\nmapped to the sixth Traditional Orthography vowel\nletter `{y}`.\n\nNext we assign the Quikscript letters which are paired\nwith the Quikscript letters for the &#39;lax&#39; vowels to the\ncorresponding Traditional Orthography upper-case vowel-\nletters. Some of these mappings make no &#39;phonetic&#39;\nsense; rather one has to remember the mapping of lower-\ncase Traditional Orthography vowel-letters to\nQuikscript letters, and then the rule that the\nQuikscript letters paired with these letters are\nassigned to the corresponding Traditional Orthography\nupper-case letters: #27 = `{I}`, #29 = `{E}`, #31 =\n`{I}`, #35 = `{O}`, #37 = `{Y}`, #40 = `{U}`.\n\n### Some problematic assignments\n\nWe then come to the seventh Quikscript vowel letter\npair #32-#33. They are problematic, since there are no\nTraditional Orthography vowel letters readily available\nfor them. I choose to assign them to the one\nTraditional Orthography upper-lower-case letter-pair\nnot readily associated with any English phoneme, namely\n`{Q}`-`{q}`. This does not mean that there are no\nmemory-cues available for these mappings: Quikscript\nletter #33 can be seen as a shape variation of\nQuikscript letter #34, and the Traditional Orthography\nupper-case __Q__ is of course visually similar to a\nTraditional Orthography upper-case __O__, and, likewise\nQuikscript letter #32 can be seen as a shape variation\nof Quikscript letter #30, and Traditional Orthography\nlower-case __q__ is -- admittedly vaguely -- similar to a\nTraditional Orthography lower-case script __a__.\n\nLast we come the unpaired Quikscript vowel-letter #38.\nIt&#39;s sound is usually associated with the Traditional\nOrthography letter __o__, or one of the digraphs __oa, ou__\nor __ow__ which all contain __o__, but due to my choosen\nsystem for assigning the &#39;paired&#39; Quikscript vowel-\nletters to ASCII letters `{o}` and `{O}` are already\noccupied by Quikscript letters #34-#35. Quikscript\nletter #38 must therefore be assigned to the otherwise\nunused Traditional Orthography upper-case letter __B__,\nwhich at least allows us to use the words &quot;bowl&quot; and\n&quot;bow&quot; (the noun), which recall the shape of the letter\nin the Quikscript Manual, as memory-cues. I readily\nadmit, however that this is the weakest point of my\nproposal: if one finds the system for assigning the\nother vowels an advantage in favor of my proposal one\nwill simply have to take this weakness in the bargain!\nIt was tempting to assign Quikscript letter #38 to the\nASCII `@` symbol, but I preferred to assign all the\nQuikscript letters which are sanctioned by the\nQuikscript Manual to Traditional Orthography upper- or\nlower-case letters leaving the ASCII symbol characters\nalone, and the namer dot to the &#39;back-tick&#39; `{&#92;`}`\nwhich is superfluous in normal typing, pace TeX.\n\n### Consonants\n\nThere are few innovations among the primary consonants,\nsince the majority of Quikscript consonant-letters have an\nobvious one-to-one counterpart in Traditional Orthography.\nMost of the remaining Quikscript consonant-letters have been\nassigned them to the upper- case version of the letters for\nthe most similar sounds already assigned to a lower-case\nletter, and I think few will argue against the assignments\n#7 = `{T}`, #8 = `{D}`, #13 = `{S}`, #14 = `{Z}`, nor with\nthe assignment of #15 to lower-case `{c}`, where the added\ncomplication of having to press the shift key seemed\nunwarranted, despite the apparent regularity of upper- case\ncorresponding to an added __h__ in Traditional Orthography.\nOne might have preferred mapping Quikscript letter #13 to\nASCII upper- case `{C}` and Quikscript letter #14 to ASCII\nupper-case `{J}`, but the system of vowel- assignments has\nalready preempted the pair `{y}`-`{Y}` for use as vowels, so\nthat ASCII lower-case `{j}` had to be assigned to Quikscript\nletter #17, making it necessary to assign Quikscript letter\n#16 to ASCII upper-case `{J}`, in spite of this being a step\naway from native speakers&#39; and writer&#39;s intuitions about\nTraditional Orthography letter-to-sound correspondances. At\nleast it agrees with the old Quikscript font mapping.\n\nThe reassignment -- in fact swapping -- of the\nassignments of `{G}` and `{N}` may be a cause for concern\nfor those used to &#39;traditional&#39; Quikscript fonts, but I\nthink it is warranted: the Traditional Orthography\nspelling __ng__ at least contains a __g__, while words like\n__now, knack, knife, need__ -- the the Quikscript Manual\nexamples of initial alternate #23 -- don&#39;t, making\ntranscriptions like `{loGiG, NY, Nak, NAf, NId}` more\nreadibly recognizable than `{loNiN, GY, Gak, GAf,\nGId}`. I&#39;m prepared to back down on this point,\nhowever.\n\n## Benct Philip Jonsson&#39;s Quikscript key mapping\nproposal No. 2\n\nI have been considering a different arrangement which\nwould allow the assignment of Quikscript letter #17 to\nASCII lower-case `{y}` and other differences which\nwould allow memory-cues which are perhaps more\nintuitive in terms of native speakers&#39; and writers&#39;\nexpectations of Traditional Orthography sound-to-letter\ncorrespondences, including the well-nigh universal\ninclination to map Quikscript letter #36 to lower-case\n`{u}`. Alas upper-case `{B}` would still be assigned to a\nvowel, and now memory-cued to the word &quot;bout&quot;, and\nprobably those who are familiar with the __&#x0223;__\nligature form of the __ou__ digraph will be aided by its\nvisual similarity to upper-case __B__.\n\n### Assignments which differ between BPJ 1 and BPJ 2.1\n\n| QS # | (Jerome)| Name        | BPJ 1| BPJ 2.1     |\n|------|---------|-------------|------|-------------|\n| #14  |Z        | J&#39;ai        | Z    | J *         |\n| #16  |J        | Jay         | J    | j *         |\n| #17  |j        | Ye          | j    | y *         |\n| #31  |F        | I           | A *  | Y *         |\n| #32  |y        | Ah          | q *  | A *         |\n| #35  |q        | Oy          | O *  | q           |\n| #36  |a        | Utter       | y *  | u *         |\n| #37  |Q        | Out         | Y *  | B *         |\n| #39  |U        | Foot        | u *  | V *         |\n| #38  |O        | Owe         | B *  | O           |\n| #36  |u        | Up          | V *  | C *         |\n| #12.5|L        | half-Zoo    | C *  | Z *         |\n\nThese changes do in fact amount to a different\nproposal, since it no longer includes the &#39;Quikscript-\ninternal&#39; &#39;paired&#39; vowel-letter assignments.
