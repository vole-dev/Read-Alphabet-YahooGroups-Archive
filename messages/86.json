It is nice to be read and considered.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpell Checkers  **************************<br/>\n<br/>\nJon mentioned that spell checkers do not work for quickscript.  True <br/>\nenough, unless we spend the time to build a dictionary to check our <br/>\nspellings... which could be done but is a long term project.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf more interest to me is the nasty habit of MS Word&#39;s auto correct <br/>\nfeatures.  It is nice when it corrects my lack of a capital letter in <br/>\nenglish at the beginning a sentence or auto corrects my usual <br/>\nmisspellings.  But I always need to remember to turn that little <br/>\nfeature off when I am writing in Shavian or Quickscript!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have occasionally gone back to look at what I had written only to <br/>\nfind that a bunch of words made no sense when I read them... it was <br/>\nthe auto correct at fault.  It&#39;s bad enough that I automatically want <br/>\nto make the first letter of every sentence start with a capital... <br/>\nwhich is the wrong thing to do in these scripts.<br/>\n<br/>\nPosting with Quickscript ***************<br/>\n<br/>\nI need a little help here.  It is very difficult for me to post in <br/>\nthe scripts we are working with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have discovered that I *can* post with my email program (The Yahoo <br/>\ninternet email) and include script if I write the whole post in html <br/>\nas a text file and preview the html before I send it.  Of course, I <br/>\nhave to remember to include all the html for paragraph breaks and <br/>\nall...  What a pain!  It is also ugly to be typing and looking at the <br/>\nroman characters and only later get to see the quickscript. <br/>\n<br/>\nWorse, I have not found a way to include any html in a response I <br/>\nwrite when I am working directly out of the group page as a post. <br/>\n(like now) What is the clue to get the system to allow me to post <br/>\nhtml...  Even better, how can I actually see the quickscript I would <br/>\nlike to be writing as I type it and then paste it into the post <br/>\nwindow???  (Or even post as quickscript font???)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;Shavian&quot; Ironboard maintained by Hugh is a great little <br/>\ninvention where all the entries are automatically written in <br/>\nLionspaw.  Is there a way to do anything similar here???<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not used Outlook for this problem, as I have tried to keep off <br/>\noutlook outside my work environment.  (virus attacks) Will posting <br/>\nwork better if I break down and use outlook?  Is that the secret to a <br/>\npretty little post like Jon sent me yesterday?  His ability to easily <br/>\nmix the roman english and the quickscript font was very nice.  I <br/>\nwould like to be able to do the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n/rik</div>",
