I myself am reading Edmund Spenser&#39;s Faerie<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; Queene (1590) right now, and even though there are no J&#39;s, and<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; V&#39;s and<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; U&#39;s change depending on whether the letter appears at the<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; beginning of<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; a word, I am not having any trouble reading it, even with the<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; irregularity of spelling.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; What I think more than anything will prove what we&#39;re talking about<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; (not proving that someone&#39;s right or wrong, but testing the<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; situation<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; itself) is actual usage. Were someone to start a periodical in<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; Quickscript as discussed earlier, with contributors from varying<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; locations, it seems to me that the only concern for the materials<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; would be that they actually do match the spoken language, and are<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; not<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; just errors made from thinking in traditional orthography. We can<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; talk all day long about how things could be, but the only thing<br/>\n&gt;     that<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; matters is how things are or will be in actuality.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; -Benjamin Bruce<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; BenjaminBruce.com<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; 2007/9/10, pgabhart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pgabhart@...\">pgabhart@...</a><br/>\n&gt;     &lt;mailto:pgabhart%40sbcglobal.net&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &lt;mailto:pgabhart% &lt;mailto:pgabhart%25&gt;40sbcglobal.net<br/>\n&gt;     &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40sbcglobal.net\">http://40sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pgabhart@...\">pgabhart@...</a><br/>\n&gt;     &lt;mailto:pgabhart%40sbcglobal.net&gt; &lt;mailto: pgabhart%<br/>\n&gt;     &lt;mailto:pgabhart%25&gt;40sbcglobal.net &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40sbcglobal.net\">http://40sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; First, I disagree with the statement &quot;QS is meant to be heard.&quot; Not<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; meaning to be categorical, but QS is an attempt to realign English<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; with<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; an alphabet that works the way an alphabet is supposed to: one<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; sound =<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; one phoneme. The QS manual starts off with the reasons why<br/>\n&gt;     trying to<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; redesign the Roman alphabet just doesn&#39;t cut it. A new alphabet<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; was needed.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; The problem I see with standardized spelling is that the<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &quot;English-speaking Peoples&quot; have no language academy to even<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; attempt to<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; enforce spelling changes as the language continues to evolve.<br/>\n&gt;     That is<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; sort of how we got in this mess (TO) to begin with.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; I may be abysmally ignorant of the extent of English dialects,<br/>\n&gt;     but I<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; suspect that for a very large majority of English speakers,<br/>\n&gt;     i.e. the<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; ones clustered in the middle of the bell curve of English<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; pronunciation,<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; we could get along just fine without a standardized spelling<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; because the<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; majority of the words we use on a daily basis are not going to be<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; spelt<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; so peculiarly by someone from a different, but still one of the<br/>\n&gt;     major<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; speech communities that it would not be recognizable. To be sure,<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; there<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; are the outliers on that bell curve who would need to conform their<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; speech to a dialect in broader use than their own such as they<br/>\n&gt;     would<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; hear on the BBC or from American news outlets. But for most of<br/>\n&gt;     us, I<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; doubt we would need spelling police. For example, if I write<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &quot;schedule&quot;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; with a &quot;k&quot; sound, and a Londoner reads it, I seriously doubt, he<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; would<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; have more than a moment&#39;s hesitation in deciphering the word even<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; though<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; he doesn&#39;t pronounce it that way.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; If we start insisting that every word must be spelt in accordance<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; with<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; an arbitrary standard that does not match anyone&#39;s speech<br/>\n&gt;     completely,<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; then we will be back to looking up many words and memorizing their<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; spelling. It is my understanding that in Shakespeare&#39;s time,<br/>\n&gt;     the idea<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; of proper spelling did not exist, and the Bard was quite content to<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; spell a word one way today and differently tomorrow. That<br/>\n&gt;     apparently<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t hold him back We all have been prejudiced by our<br/>\n&gt;     schooling and<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; what Kingsley Read called the &quot;cultural fetish&quot; of spelling to<br/>\n&gt;     reject<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; the idea that we can spell words the way we want. If we go too far<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; astray, our readers won&#39;t understand, and we pay the price of not<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; being<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; read. That by itself, forces a high level of conformism onto the<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; situation, but to insist that we all have to spell in lockstep<br/>\n&gt;     or be<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; considered morons is quite a different matter.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; I have seen a number of people insist that we have to have<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; standardized<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; spelling or we are doomed, but I doubt anyone has actually studied<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; this<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; so we have no real data as to how an alternative English alphabet<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; would<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; work if it did or did not use standardized spelling. For<br/>\n&gt;     example, let<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; us assume that we don&#39;t insist on standardized spelling and that<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; it was<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; later found that that decision slowed the average reading speed by<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; 5 or<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; 10 % (I doubt it would be any greater than that). Would that<br/>\n&gt;     not be a<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; reasonable price to pay to avoid putting ourselves back in the<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; position<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; of attempting to memorize how words should be spelt rather than<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; spelling<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; them the way they sound in speech? I believe it would,<br/>\n&gt;     especially for<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; the dyslexics among us, who cannot deal with arbitrary spellings.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; If a person occasionally is unsure how to spell a word because he<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; suspects he may pronounce it differently than others, he could<br/>\n&gt;     always<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; look it up in a dictionary. This is better than trying to memorize<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; spelling of virtually his entire vocabulary in order to have it<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; comply<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; with an arbitrary standard of speech.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; Paige<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; John Cowan wrote:<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; amd64_hacker scripsit:<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I&#39;m for abbreviations in all texts.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that since QS is meant to be &#39;heard&#39; it<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t matter<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how the word is written but how it is read.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, yes, but that slows down reading to the speed of speech. I<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; suspect<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; that rapid silent reading and standardized orthography go<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; together --<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; we do know that fluent readers recognize familiar words by the<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; total<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; shape of the word, slowing down only when they must to read an<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; unfamilar<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; word, and that this is equally true in languages that are<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; rationally<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; spelled, irrationally spelled, or not spelled at all (like<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; Chinese).<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; So if QS is going to become important for works meant to be read<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; more than once (as opposed to shorthand/transcription uses), a<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; standardized orthography will have to evolve.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; Which immediately leads to the issue of dialects. One&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;     obvious and<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; natural phonetic orthography is another&#39;s stumbling block. (&quot;Hmm,<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; is it spelled &#39;theft&#39; or &#39;feft&#39;?&quot; &quot;Hmm, does this mean &#39;lord&#39; or<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;laud&#39;?&quot;) A universal orthography ends up needing to make more<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; distinctions<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; than any one dialect actually needs, and thus to some extent<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; becoming<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; artificial to all.<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; John Cowan <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cowan@...\">cowan@...</a> &lt;mailto:cowan%40ccil.org&gt; &lt;mailto:<br/>\n&gt;     cowan% &lt;mailto:cowan%25&gt;40ccil.org &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">http://40ccil.org</a>&gt;&gt; &lt;mailto:<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; cowan% &lt;mailto:cowan% &lt;mailto:cowan%25&gt;25&gt;40ccil.org<br/>\n&gt;     &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">http://40ccil.org</a>&gt; &lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">http://40ccil.org</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">http://40ccil.org</a>&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;mailto:<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; cowan% &lt;mailto:cowan% &lt;mailto:cowan%25&gt; &lt;mailto: cowan%<br/>\n&gt;     &lt;mailto:cowan%25&gt;25&gt;25&gt;40ccil.org &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">http://40ccil.org</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">http://40ccil.org</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">http://40ccil.org</a>&gt;&gt; &lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">http://40ccil.org</a><br/>\n&gt;     &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">http://40ccil.org</a>&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">http://40ccil.org</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://40ccil.org\">http://40ccil.org</a>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Mr. Lane, if you ever wish anything that I can do, all you<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; will have<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; to do will be to send me a telegram asking and it will be done.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Mr. Hearst, if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; anything, you can put the telegram down as a forgery.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",

I&#39;ve managed to teach myself how to write in QS (or so it seems\n&gt;     &gt; to me), but it would be a great help to have more examples to read.\n&gt;     &gt; After reading the Quickscript Manual, I looked for other examples of\n&gt;     &gt; written Quickscript. The main source that I have been using is the\n&gt;     &gt; file &quot;QS_Dict_TextOnly.txt&quot; which is included in\n&gt;     QsConverter_1_2_1.zip\n&gt;     &gt; under Files &gt; QsConverter, for this Yahoo group. Since I don&#39;t use\n&gt;     &gt; Windows, I could not use the converter itself, but I reformatted the\n&gt;     &gt; file into a Rich Text Format document, which is nicely searchable. If\n&gt;     &gt; anyone would like to see this file, I&#39;ve put it here:\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; http://staff.washington.edu/freeman/qs/qs_dict.rtf\n&gt;     &lt;http://staff.washington.edu/freeman/qs/qs_dict.rtf&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &lt;http://staff.washington.edu/freeman/qs/qs_dict.rtf\n&gt;     &lt;http://staff.washington.edu/freeman/qs/qs_dict.rtf&gt;&gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Instead of a periodical for writing in Quickscript, here is what I&#39;ve\n&gt;     &gt; been wanting to create: a website, similar to the Babelfish website.\n&gt;     &gt; The user could enter a URL, and the site would recast the page using\n&gt;     &gt; Quickscript. This would be significantly easier than translation, and\n&gt;     &gt; would mainly require a dictionary, preferably a current online\n&gt;     &gt; dictionary with IPA pronunciations. The dictionary would need to be\n&gt;     &gt; fast. Any suggestions?\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; I have one or two beginner&#39;s question. Having grown up speaking North\n&gt;     &gt; American English in the area of the cot-caught merger, I have\n&gt;     &gt; difficulty distinguishing between QS letters 32, 33, and 34. I&#39;ve\n&gt;     &gt; noticed that the file &quot;QS_Dict_TextOnly.txt&quot; doesn&#39;t contain a single\n&gt;     &gt; instance of letter 34, which puzzles me. I also have difficulty\n&gt;     &gt; imagining using 33+25 for &quot;or&quot;; I would tend to write 38+25. I&#39;m\n&gt;     happy\n&gt;     &gt; to memorize a few combinations that don&#39;t correspond with my own\n&gt;     &gt; pronunciation, but an extended set of examples would be helpful.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Thanks.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Ted\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; On 9/12/07, *pgabhart* &lt;pgabhart@...\n&gt;     &lt;mailto:pgabhart%40sbcglobal.net&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &lt;mailto:pgabhart@...\n&gt;     &lt;mailto:pgabhart%40sbcglobal.net&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; I noticed that in my recent post in which I wrote about the way an\n&gt;     &gt; alphabet was intended to work: &quot;one sound = one phoneme.&quot; Of\n&gt;     &gt; course, I\n&gt;     &gt; meant to write &quot;one symbol = one phoneme&quot;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Your experience with /Faerie Queene /matches my expectation that\n&gt;     &gt; occasional aberrant spellings are not the end of the world. And,\n&gt;     &gt; as you\n&gt;     &gt; say, the only way to test how much of a problem it is by reading the\n&gt;     &gt; spelling of people from different speech communities. When I\n&gt;     &gt; corresponded with a gentleman from New Zealand in 1975, I don&#39;t\n&gt;     &gt; remember\n&gt;     &gt; having any particular difficulty in reading his QS.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; I think a periodical in QS would be great. Who wants to get this\n&gt;     &gt; organized? Don&#39;t everyone volunteer at once. :-) Where could we get\n&gt;     &gt; copy that isn&#39;t copyrighted that we could just transliterate into QS?\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Paige\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Benjamin Bruce wrote:\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; While reading Paige&#39;s message about standardized spelling, I\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; thought about how English-speaking folks lived without it back\n&gt;     &gt; during\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; the Renaissance period. I myself am reading Edmund Spenser&#39;s Faerie\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; Queene (1590) right now, and even though there are no J&#39;s, and\n&gt;     &gt; V&#39;s and\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; U&#39;s change depending on whether the letter appears at the\n&gt;     &gt; beginning of\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; a word, I am not having any trouble reading it, even with the\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; irregularity of spelling.\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; What I think more than anything will prove what we&#39;re talking about\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; (not proving that someone&#39;s right or wrong, but testing the\n&gt;     &gt; situation\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; itself) is actual usage. Were someone to start a periodical in\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; Quickscript as discussed earlier, with contributors from varying\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; locations, it seems to me that the only concern for the materials\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; would be that they actually do match the spoken language, and are\n&gt;     &gt; not\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; just errors made from thinking in traditional orthography. We can\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; talk all day long about how things could be, but the only thing\n&gt;     that\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; matters is how things are or will be in actuality.\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; -Benjamin Bruce\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; BenjaminBruce.com\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; 2007/9/10, pgabhart &lt;pgabhart@...\n&gt;     &lt;mailto:pgabhart%40sbcglobal.net&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &lt;mailto:pgabhart% &lt;mailto:pgabhart%25&gt;40sbcglobal.net\n&gt;     &lt;http://40sbcglobal.net&gt;&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:pgabhart@...\n&gt;     &lt;mailto:pgabhart%40sbcglobal.net&gt; &lt;mailto: pgabhart%\n&gt;     &lt;mailto:pgabhart%25&gt;40sbcglobal.net &lt;http://40sbcglobal.net&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; First, I disagree with the statement &quot;QS is meant to be heard.&quot; Not\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; meaning to be categorical, but QS is an attempt to realign English\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; with\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; an alphabet that works the way an alphabet is supposed to: one\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; sound =\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; one phoneme. The QS manual starts off with the reasons why\n&gt;     trying to\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; redesign the Roman alphabet just doesn&#39;t cut it. A new alphabet\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; was needed.\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; The problem I see with standardized spelling is that the\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &quot;English-speaking Peoples&quot; have no language academy to even\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; attempt to\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; enforce spelling changes as the language continues to evolve.\n&gt;     That is\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; sort of how we got in this mess (TO) to begin with.\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; I may be abysmally ignorant of the extent of English dialects,\n&gt;     but I\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; suspect that for a very large majority of English speakers,\n&gt;     i.e. the\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; ones clustered in the middle of the bell curve of English\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; pronunciation,\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; we could get along just fine without a standardized spelling\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; because the\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; majority of the words we use on a daily basis are not going to be\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; spelt\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; so peculiarly by someone from a different, but still one of the\n&gt;     major\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; speech communities that it would not be recognizable. To be sure,\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; there\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; are the outliers on that bell curve who would need to conform their\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; speech to a dialect in broader use than their own such as they\n&gt;     would\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; hear on the BBC or from American news outlets. But for most of\n&gt;     us, I\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; doubt we would need spelling police. For example, if I write\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &quot;schedule&quot;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; with a &quot;k&quot; sound, and a Londoner reads it, I seriously doubt, he\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; would\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; have more than a moment&#39;s hesitation in deciphering the word even\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; though\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; he doesn&#39;t pronounce it that way.\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; If we start insisting that every word must be spelt in accordance\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; with\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; an arbitrary standard that does not match anyone&#39;s speech\n&gt;     completely,\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; then we will be back to looking up many words and memorizing their\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; spelling. It is my understanding that in Shakespeare&#39;s time,\n&gt;     the idea\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; of proper spelling did not exist, and the Bard was quite content to\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; spell a word one way today and differently tomorrow. That\n&gt;     apparently\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t hold him back We all have been prejudiced by our\n&gt;     schooling and\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; what Kingsley Read called the &quot;cultural fetish&quot; of spelling to\n&gt;     reject\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; the idea that we can spell words the way we want. If we go too far\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; astray, our readers won&#39;t understand, and we pay the price of not\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; being\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; read. That by itself, forces a high level of conformism onto the\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; situation, but to insist that we all have to spell in lockstep\n&gt;     or be\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; considered morons is quite a different matter.\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; I have seen a number of people insist that we have to have\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; standardized\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; spelling or we are doomed, but I doubt anyone has actually studied\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; this\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; so we have no real data as to how an alternative English alphabet\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; would\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; work if it did or did not use standardized spelling. For\n&gt;     example, let\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; us assume that we don&#39;t insist on standardized spelling and that\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; it was\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; later found that that decision slowed the average reading speed by\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; 5 or\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; 10 % (I doubt it would be any greater than that). Would that\n&gt;     not be a\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; reasonable price to pay to avoid putting ourselves back in the\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; position\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; of attempting to memorize how words should be spelt rather than\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; spelling\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; them the way they sound in speech? I believe it would,\n&gt;     especially for\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; the dyslexics among us, who cannot deal with arbitrary spellings.\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; If a person occasionally is unsure how to spell a word because he\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; suspects he may pronounce it differently than others, he could\n&gt;     always\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; look it up in a dictionary. This is better than trying to memorize\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; the\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; spelling of virtually his entire vocabulary in order to have it\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; comply\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; with an arbitrary standard of speech.\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; Paige\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; John Cowan wrote:\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; amd64_hacker scripsit:\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I&#39;m for abbreviations in all texts.\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that since QS is meant to be &#39;heard&#39; it\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t matter\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how the word is written but how it is read.\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, yes, but that slows down reading to the speed of speech. I\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; suspect\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; that rapid silent reading and standardized orthography go\n&gt;     &gt; together --\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; we do know that fluent readers recognize familiar words by the\n&gt;     &gt; total\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; shape of the word, slowing down only when they must to read an\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; unfamilar\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; word, and that this is equally true in languages that are\n&gt;     &gt; rationally\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; spelled, irrationally spelled, or not spelled at all (like\n&gt;     &gt; Chinese).\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; So if QS is going to become important for works meant to be read\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; more than once (as opposed to shorthand/transcription uses), a\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; standardized orthography will have to evolve.\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; Which immediately leads to the issue of dialects. One&#39;s\n&gt;     obvious and\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; natural phonetic orthography is another&#39;s stumbling block. (&quot;Hmm,\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; is it spelled &#39;theft&#39; or &#39;feft&#39;?&quot; &quot;Hmm, does this mean &#39;lord&#39; or\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;laud&#39;?&quot;) A universal orthography ends up needing to make more\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; distinctions\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; than any one dialect actually needs, and thus to some extent\n&gt;     &gt; becoming\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; artificial to all.\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; John Cowan cowan@... &lt;mailto:cowan%40ccil.org&gt; &lt;mailto:\n&gt;     cowan% &lt;mailto:cowan%25&gt;40ccil.org &lt;http://40ccil.org&gt;&gt; &lt;mailto:\n&gt;     &gt; cowan% &lt;mailto:cowan% &lt;mailto:cowan%25&gt;25&gt;40ccil.org\n&gt;     &lt;http://40ccil.org&gt; &lt; http://40ccil.org &lt;http://40ccil.org&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;mailto:\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; cowan% &lt;mailto:cowan% &lt;mailto:cowan%25&gt; &lt;mailto: cowan%\n&gt;     &lt;mailto:cowan%25&gt;25&gt;25&gt;40ccil.org &lt;http://40ccil.org&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &lt;http://40ccil.org &lt;http://40ccil.org&gt;&gt; &lt; http://40ccil.org\n&gt;     &lt;http://40ccil.org&gt; &lt;http://40ccil.org &lt;http://40ccil.org&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Mr. Lane, if you ever wish anything that I can do, all you\n&gt;     &gt; will have\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; to do will be to send me a telegram asking and it will be done.&quot;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Mr. Hearst, if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt; anything, you can put the telegram down as a forgery.&quot;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"
