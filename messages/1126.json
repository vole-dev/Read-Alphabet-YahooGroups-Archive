In \nactual use, however, it had some problems, though, and the fonts that \ncame after it were focused more on junior QS.  A new attempt at a senior \nQS font would be welcome and certainly interesting.  I, for one, would \nconsider using it if you could get it to work well.  It would permit the \ncomputer to reproduce the cursive character of QS which I find so \ninteresting.\n\nThis is not to say that an artistic, well-designed junior QS font is not \nneeded.  Paul Tremblay is working on just such a new junior font now \nthat will deal with some of the issues the existing junior fonts have \nhad.  I have great hopes for it.\n\nThanks for your interest, and I would be happy to assist you in any way \nI can if you decide to work on such a project.\n\nPaige\n\nothermale wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt;\n&gt; I wonder, does anyone know of an attempt to represent _senior_\n&gt; quikscript typographically (ie enterable and viewable on a computer)?\n&gt; I suppose this would be quite a bit more than just a font (eg the\n&gt; challenge of joining the letter &quot;roar&quot;(aka &quot;roe&quot;) and half letter\n&gt; &quot;zoo&quot; in the abbreviation for Mrs. or the joining of &quot;sis&quot;(&quot;see&quot;) with\n&gt; &quot;pipe&quot;(&quot;pea&quot;) ).
