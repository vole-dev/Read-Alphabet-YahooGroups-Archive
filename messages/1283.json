Shouldn&#39;t you use Thither for &quot;the,&quot; &quot;Valve&quot; for &quot;of,&quot; &quot;Tut&quot; <br/>\n&gt;for &quot;to&quot; and &quot;It&quot; for &quot;if?&quot; I have come to expect these one letter <br/>\n&gt;abbreviations (which Read said were a part of QS) when I read a <br/>\n&gt;text. I actually changed all of these words before I printed out <br/>\n&gt;the poem so I could read it easier.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t really been using the standard abreviations when using QS <br/>\nfor notes, or the one person I IM. That&#39;s something I need to get <br/>\nused to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. line 10: you spell &quot;borrow&quot; with the &quot;Ah,&quot; which made the words <br/>\n&gt;hard for me to decipher. I expected &quot;On,&quot; or &quot;Awl.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; 3. line 12. The words &quot;for evermore&quot; should be joined? I found <br/>\n&gt;them joined in one Gutenberg text.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Makes sense to me, but the copy I have from Gutenberg has them <br/>\nseparated, and if that&#39;s how Poe wrote it, who am I to edit? Of <br/>\ncourse, if that&#39;s not how he wrote it, I need to change it, so I <br/>\nwill check a few sources.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4. line 33 (and others, too). You spell &quot;shall&quot; with &quot;Ash.&quot; I <br/>\n&gt;expected &quot;Ado,&quot; so had a hard time reading the word.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s just how I say it, rhymes with &quot;Hal&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5 line 39 (and others). You spell not with &quot;Ah.&quot; I expected &quot;Awl&quot; <br/>\n&gt;or &quot;On,&quot; so was a bit confused.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right. I should have used &quot;Awl&quot;. That would be closer to how <br/>\nI pronounce it. It&#39;s the old 32-33-34 issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 6. line 40. You have the wrong word. You use an &quot;and&quot;<br/>\n&gt;between &quot;lord&quot; and &quot;lady&quot; when it should be &quot;or.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;or&quot; would make more sense in the sentence, but &quot;and&quot; is what is in <br/>\nmy copy from Gutenberg. I had to double check after I read your note.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 7. Line 47 You spell ghastly with &quot;Ash,&quot; but I expected &quot;Ah.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;(Is that just my Boston accent?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Must be your accent!

Also, remember that for the most part, <br/>\n32 and 34 are the same, so I just never use 34. I suppose the choice <br/>\nof 32 is arbitrary. Seems there should be a reason to chose one over <br/>\nthe other, even if you pronounce them both the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 11. line 89. You spell &quot;balm&quot; with &quot;Awl,&quot; but I expected &quot;Ah.&quot; (My<br/>\n&gt; Boston accent again?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It must be my screwy accent. That&#39;s just how I pronounce it.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 12. line 93. You spell &quot;sorrow&quot; with &quot;Ah,&quot; when I expected &quot;Awl&quot;<br/>\n&gt;or &quot;On.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And a third one. I should have used &quot;Awe&quot;. I will make the changes <br/>\nand replace it on the site.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I see you used my Shawtwo font. How flattering!
