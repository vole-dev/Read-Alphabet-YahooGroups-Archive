Perhaps more experience readers don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;  have this problem. But if we have a ligature for Ado + Roar that always<br/>\n&gt;  equals the sound in NURSE, we can avoid this confusion.

Besides the example above, I come<br/>\n&gt;  across the Ed Roar combination for words in which I would use Age-Roar.<br/>\n&gt;  It takes me a while to figure out such words.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Paul<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",
