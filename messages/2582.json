I suppose the main point here is that writing is co=\r\nmmunication within a group of people and in order to do it successfully an =\r\nagreed method for mutual understanding is necessary and has to be worked ou=\r\nt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-fam=\r\nily: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; background-color: transpa=\r\nrent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(=\r\n0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, time=\r\ns, serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I can&#39;t=\r\n help but be fascinated by the way in which regular standardized spelling s=\r\nystems like we have in English actually mask the changes happening in the l=\r\nanguage. Something which Quickscript shines a light on.

Well how wr=\r\nong I was. Audio recordings were critical for learning the Moscow pronuncia=\r\ntion and seeing how the spelling differed from true speech.

If I want to ask H. P. Lovecraft (1830=E2=80=931937)=\r\n how to pronounce &quot;wgah&#39;nagl&quot;, I&#39;m going to have to put down my book and bu=\r\ny =E2=80=94 or design =E2=80=94 a *very* specialized ouija board. Having to=\r\n pause my reading and go &quot;hmmm, what word does the author really mean?&quot; is =\r\na huge speed impediment, if nothing else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If everyone spells the sam=\r\ne way, things are easier and faster to read, since you don&#39;t have to try to=\r\n imagine how to correct for one particular speaker&#39;s idiosyncrasies. &quot;Every=\r\none learn\n how to read and write spellings based on how an RP speaker would=\r\n pronounce things in 1960, and add rhoticity&quot; is an easier rule to follow t=\r\nhan &quot;everyone learn how to write their own dialect and read everyone else&#39;s=\r\n&quot;. Similarly, &quot;everyone learn English&quot;, &quot;everyone learn French&quot;, and &quot;every=\r\none learn Latin&quot; have generally been more popular than &quot;every European lear=\r\nn every other European language&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Cowan already demonstrated ho=\r\nw bad the mutual-intelligibility problem can get in &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/Read_Alphabet/message/2423&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/Read_Alphabet/message/2423&lt;/a&gt;&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; To m=\r\nake things worse, writing in QS exactly as we speak will cause severe&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; problems with intelligibility across accent boundaries. If Alice from&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; London writes &lt;Fife, Eat, Fife&gt;, North Americans will not recog=\r\nnize this&lt;br&gt;&gt; as &quot;thief&quot;. If Bob from Philadelphia writes &lt;Deed, Ah,=\r\n\n Loll&gt;, people&lt;br&gt;&gt; from outside North America will not recognize th=\r\nis as &quot;doll&quot;. If Charlie&lt;br&gt;&gt; from Edinburgh writes &lt;Tut, Ed, Roar, M=\r\nime&gt;, only people from Scotland&lt;br&gt;&gt; and Ireland and those who know t=\r\nraditional orthography will recognize&lt;br&gt;&gt; this as &quot;term&quot;. If David from=\r\n New Zealand writes &lt;Sis, Ado, Ax&gt;, only&lt;br&gt;&gt; his countrymen will =\r\nrecognize this as &quot;six&quot;; all other anglophones will&lt;br&gt;&gt; take it to be &quot;=\r\nsucks&quot;. (&quot;Australia sux, New Zealand nil.&quot;) Likewise,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Eve from Cali=\r\nfornia will bewilder most of us with her &lt;Kick, Eat,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Inkling&gt;=\r\n, as the rest of us say &lt;Kick, If, Inkling&gt; for &quot;king&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; When Frank, a policeman from Chicago, writes that he searched every &lt=\r\n;Bob,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Loll, Ash, Kick&gt; for guns, the rest of us may think this i=\r\ns racial&lt;br&gt;&gt; profiling, but Frank merely meant that he searched every &quot;=\r\nblock&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Greta from Newcastle-on-Tyne may write &lt;Kick,\n Wool, Dee=\r\nd&gt;, and people&lt;br&gt;&gt; outside the North of England will think she is wr=\r\niting &quot;could&quot; rather than&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;cud&quot;. When Henry from Cardiff, Princess =\r\nImogen of Britain, James from&lt;br&gt;&gt; Melbourne, and Kayla from Indianapoli=\r\ns write &lt;Deed, If, Win-win&gt;, &lt;Deed,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Yo-yo, Ooze&gt;, &lt;J=\r\nudge, Ooze&gt;, and &lt;Deed, Ooze&gt; respectively, it will take&lt;br&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhem some work to figure out that all these spellings represent the word&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &quot;dew&quot;.
