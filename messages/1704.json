  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2033112162\">I am just getting my toes wet in Quickscript, which I find very<br/>\ninteresting.  I am especially interested at the moment in the fact<br/>\nthat it is a writing system for English that allows people to write as<br/>\nthey speak.  In the USA, for example, we have regional accents that<br/>\nessentially disappear when we write English, but which are apparent<br/>\nwhen we speak/listen; Quickscript allows those differences to appear<br/>\nnaturally in writing if they are desired.  I can also see that<br/>\nQuickscript could be very useful to someone who is studying English as<br/>\na foreign language.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I have said all that, I will get to the major reason for this<br/>\nmessage: I would like to connect with another person who is new to<br/>\nQuickscript so that we can exchange hand-written exercises in letter<br/>\nformation and word formation, struggling our way toward--gasp!--actual<br/>\nsentences. If you feel the same need for support and constructive<br/>\ncriticism that I do, please contact me.  (I live in California, USA,<br/>\nwhere we generally are seen/heard as not having a regional accent in<br/>\ncomparison with some other areas of the country.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy communicating to all!</div>",
