First let me thank you for myself and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the group for your willingness to put your effort and time into this<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for us all.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I had not found the time to look your proposal in detail previously.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Here are my thoughts.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; First, a couple of minor things:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; At the beginning of the proposal, there is a duplicated &quot;with.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; A caseless, phonetic, left-to-right alphabet optimised for the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; English language (but still useful for other languages with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; similar sounds) created by (Ronald) Kingsley Read. It is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the successor to and has much in common with /with/ Shavian.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Authoritative documentation for it can be found in \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c5\u201cThe<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; QuikScript Alphabet\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd. [emphasis added]<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In the following paragraph under &quot;Alternate Forms,&quot; I suggest changing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the word &quot;usually&quot; to &quot;highly&quot; since some letters can be properly<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; connected and some cannot.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Many letters have half height or alternate forms in order to help<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; speed up writing by reducing the number of strokes and pen lifts.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The half height and alternate forms are only used in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00cb\u0153senior\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; QuikScript which is /usually/ cursive. [emphasis added]<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Whether a given writer decides to connect any letter to another is his<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; choice, but I would consider it improper to extend or change the form<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of a letter in order to make a connection to the next letter possible.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I believe the only exceptions approved by Read in the QS manual are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for the letters with alternate forms (N-o and U-tter) and for F-ee,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; M-ay and TH-ey.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The alternate &quot;TH-ey&quot; extends the bottom of the letter upwards to the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; lower writing line to permit connection with the next letter. Read<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; terms this an &quot;allowable extension,&quot; but it seems to me it should be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; considered an alternate form and listed that way in the proposal.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; While the end stroke of F-ee can also be extended to join the next<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; letter, that seems less important to me so, in my opinion, it could be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; left out of the proposal. Of course, others may feel that it should be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; included. I don&#39;t know how difficult it is to include these from a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; technical standpoint. If we make provision for some alternate forms,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; then adding a couple more is probably no big deal. In looking back at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the manual for the first time in a long time, I realize that I almost<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; habitually use the alternate form of &quot;M-ay.&quot; The standard form seems a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; little more difficult for me to write. That may be lack of practice or<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it may have something to do with being left-handed.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I am confused about your list of letters presented as having<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; half-height forms. You list 15 such letters, but the QS manual lists<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; only P-ea, T-ea, H-e, D-ay, Z-oo, and W-ay. In addition to those, I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; have used WH-y and Y-e for decades since they work as half-letters<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; just as well as the six Read suggested. I had actually forgotten they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; are not listed in the manual as half-letters until Jon Zuck pointed it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; out to me. Since it is clear what letters they are, it just made sense<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to me. Besides, I love the way the half-letters contribute to the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; variety of wordshapes possible in QS. However, you have added seven<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; more: F-ee, V-ie, S-ee, SH-e, J&#39;-ai, CH-eer, J-ay. I believe this is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; incorrect. Can you explain how they can be used as half-height forms?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have never used the two &quot;x&quot; letters as they always struck me as<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; outside the spirit of QS -- 1 phoneme to 1 symbol. It was Read&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; stated goal for &quot;x&quot; to &quot;compete&quot; with the TO &quot;x&quot; as if that was<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; necessary to avoid people deciding that QS was not viable because of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; two instances where it took two QS symbols when only one was needed in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; TO. Should &quot;x&quot; be included in the proposal. It is in the manual, and I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; guess that if it is coded, then people can choose whether to use it or<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;m impressed with the rest of the proposal. Thank you again for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; working on this.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Paige<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>",

Or you just believe the Unicode people, for some reason,\n&gt; would not want that in the encoding of QS?\n&gt;\n&gt; Paige\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; amd64_hacker wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for going over the proposal.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve fixed the double with typo.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve rewritten first paragraph of Alternate Forms - I was trying to say\n&gt;&gt; too much in too few words.\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m still not happy with the new wording though.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The extra half-height characters were due to sloppy copy and pasting on\n&gt;&gt; my part. :(\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve reduced the list to the &#39;core&#39; alternate forms for the moment.\n&gt;&gt; You mentioned YE and WHY, I&#39;ve found SEE and CHEER to be quite\n&gt;&gt; acceptable as half heights, are there any others?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m reasonably certain that adding extra alternate forms to Unicode\n&gt;&gt; would only be done during a revision to the standard (i.e. from 6.0 to\n&gt;&gt; 6.1 or 6.0 to 7.0).\n&gt;&gt; Removing alternate forms is impossible as far as I can see (for good\n&gt;&gt; reasons).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m thinking of dropping the Variant Selectors from the proposal.\n&gt;&gt; We&#39;ll almost certainly be asked to drop them once it&#39;s submitted and I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt; not sure that I can see an argument to defend them with.\n&gt;&gt; I originally thought that there may be occasions when it would be\n&gt;&gt; necessary to explicitly choose one form over another rather than letting\n&gt;&gt; the font choose for us.\n&gt;&gt; For example encoding the string: &quot;The senior form of &#39;&lt;VS1 + UTTER&gt;&#39; is\n&gt;&gt; &#39;&lt;VS2 + UTTER&gt;&#39;.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; But the more I think about it the less use I can see for them.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Paige Gabhart wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -------- Original Message --------\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: Unicode Proposal\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Sun, 23 Sep 2007 13:25:47 -0400\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Paige Gabhart &lt;pgabhart@...\n&gt;&gt; &lt;mailto:pgabhart%40sbcglobal.net&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; To: Read_alphabet@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; &lt;mailto:Read_alphabet%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; amd64_hacker:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Regarding your Unicode Proposal. First let me thank you for myself and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the group for your willingness to put your effort and time into this\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for us all.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I had not found the time to look your proposal in detail previously.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Here are my thoughts.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; First, a couple of minor things:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; At the beginning of the proposal, there is a duplicated &quot;with.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; A caseless, phonetic, left-to-right alphabet optimised for the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; English language (but still useful for other languages with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; similar sounds) created by (Ronald) Kingsley Read. It is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the successor to and has much in common with /with/ Shavian.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Authoritative documentation for it can be found in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The\n&gt;&gt; &gt; QuikScript Alphabet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. [emphasis added]\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In the following paragraph under &quot;Alternate Forms,&quot; I suggest changing\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the word &quot;usually&quot; to &quot;highly&quot; since some letters can be properly\n&gt;&gt; &gt; connected and some cannot.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Many letters have half height or alternate forms in order to help\n&gt;&gt; &gt; speed up writing by reducing the number of strokes and pen lifts.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The half height and alternate forms are only used in\n&gt;&gt; \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsenior\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\n&gt;&gt; &gt; QuikScript which is /usually/ cursive. [emphasis added]\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Whether a given writer decides to connect any letter to another is his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; choice, but I would consider it improper to extend or change the form\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of a letter in order to make a connection to the next letter possible.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I believe the only exceptions approved by Read in the QS manual are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for the letters with alternate forms (N-o and U-tter) and for F-ee,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; M-ay and TH-ey.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The alternate &quot;TH-ey&quot; extends the bottom of the letter upwards to the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; lower writing line to permit connection with the next letter. Read\n&gt;&gt; &gt; terms this an &quot;allowable extension,&quot; but it seems to me it should be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; considered an alternate form and listed that way in the proposal.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; While the end stroke of F-ee can also be extended to join the next\n&gt;&gt; &gt; letter, that seems less important to me so, in my opinion, it could be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; left out of the proposal. Of course, others may feel that it should be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; included. I don&#39;t know how difficult it is to include these from a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; technical standpoint. If we make provision for some alternate forms,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; then adding a couple more is probably no big deal. In looking back at\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the manual for the first time in a long time, I realize that I almost\n&gt;&gt; &gt; habitually use the alternate form of &quot;M-ay.&quot; The standard form seems a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; little more difficult for me to write. That may be lack of practice or\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it may have something to do with being left-handed.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I am confused about your list of letters presented as having\n&gt;&gt; &gt; half-height forms. You list 15 such letters, but the QS manual lists\n&gt;&gt; &gt; only P-ea, T-ea, H-e, D-ay, Z-oo, and W-ay. In addition to those, I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; have used WH-y and Y-e for decades since they work as half-letters\n&gt;&gt; &gt; just as well as the six Read suggested. I had actually forgotten they\n&gt;&gt; &gt; are not listed in the manual as half-letters until Jon Zuck pointed it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; out to me. Since it is clear what letters they are, it just made sense\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to me. Besides, I love the way the half-letters contribute to the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; variety of wordshapes possible in QS. However, you have added seven\n&gt;&gt; &gt; more: F-ee, V-ie, S-ee, SH-e, J&#39;-ai, CH-eer, J-ay. I believe this is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; incorrect. Can you explain how they can be used as half-height forms?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have never used the two &quot;x&quot; letters as they always struck me as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; outside the spirit of QS -- 1 phoneme to 1 symbol. It was Read&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; stated goal for &quot;x&quot; to &quot;compete&quot; with the TO &quot;x&quot; as if that was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; necessary to avoid people deciding that QS was not viable because of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; two instances where it took two QS symbols when only one was needed in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; TO. Should &quot;x&quot; be included in the proposal. It is in the manual, and I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; guess that if it is coded, then people can choose whether to use it or\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;m impressed with the rest of the proposal. Thank you again for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; working on this.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Paige\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"
