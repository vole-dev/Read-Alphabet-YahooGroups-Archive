  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1611541399\">Hello,<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp; I just found out about Quickscript a month or two ago, and\nI am learning how to write in it.&nbsp; I&#39;m a big fan of alternate\nwriting systems, and I&#39;ve invented and memorized several myself.&nbsp;\nI even tried to learn Gregg shorthand once, but finally gave up since\nit wasn&#39;t phonemic.&nbsp; Anyway, in the process of learning\nQuickscript, I&#39;ve come across a question about it:<br>\n<ol>\n  <li>I see there are three letters, which are described as having the sounds of &quot;c<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">a</span>lm&quot;, &quot;h<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">au</span>l&quot;, and &quot;\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">o</span>n&quot;,\nrespectively.&nbsp; In my dialect of English (I live in Texas), all\nthree of these are pronounced the same!&nbsp; For example, I pronounce\nthe words &quot;caught&quot; and &quot;cot&quot; with the same vowel sound as is in\n&quot;awe&quot;.&nbsp; How should I do this in Quickscript?&nbsp; I don&#39;t really\nwant to memorise how other people pronounce certain words in order to\nspell Quickscript right.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Quickscript looks like a really great alphabet,\nand I&#39;m looking forward to being able to read and wright it.&nbsp; It\nwould be great if it were more widely used, but it&#39;s kind of like\ntrying to teach Esperanto to everyone in the world; English is so\nwidespread, it would have to be an international thing.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, please let me know if any of y&#39;all can help me with this, and I&#39;ll keep working on it!<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.<br>\n<br>\n-<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Benjamin Bruce</span><br></div>",
