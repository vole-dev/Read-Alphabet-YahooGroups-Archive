If your accent merges two sounds, you must use just one QS<br/>\nletter and not attempt to use the other. Presumably the QS letter to<br/>\nchoose is the one whose RP sound most closely resembles your unified<br/>\nsound.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally, basing QS spelling on TO spellings is a disastrous plan:<br/>\n<br/>\n- It is an attempt to solve a purely theoretical problem that does not<br/>\nin fact exist: the variations in phonetic QS spelling do not remotely<br/>\nresult in unreadability even in junior and even less so in senior.  If<br/>\nan Australian spells &quot;accent&quot; with a different initial vowel, it is<br/>\njust one letter out of 6 in one word out of 50 and is unimportant. I<br/>\nbelieve I demonstrated this in comparing samples from two accents and<br/>\ncan do it again at anyone&#39;s request.<br/>\n<br/>\n- It freezes QS spelling so changes in pronunciation will never be<br/>\nreflected in writing. One is just creating a new TO with letters of a<br/>\ndifferent shape which is a pointless exercise.<br/>\n<br/>\n- One has the absurd situation of answering the question &quot;why do I<br/>\nspell it thus&quot; with &quot;because TO does and TO does it because in 13th<br/>\ncentury London the queen had a lisp&quot;. Why bother with QS if it mealy<br/>\nlengths the explanation for ludicrous spelling rather than just<br/>\nsticking to TO and it&#39;s lisping monarch.<br/>\n<br/>\n- You base QS spelling on TO words that themselves may change. eg<br/>\ncolor vs colour<br/>\n<br/>\n- There are exceptions to any such rules that will cause QS users to<br/>\nproduce exactly the wrong result: if a person merging [I] and [i] is<br/>\ntold to &quot;use #26 for words of that sound that have a TO letter &#39;i&#39; in<br/>\nthe spelling and use #27 for all others with that sound&quot; then they<br/>\nwill spell &quot;busy&quot; and &quot;bean&quot; with the same letter. in this case &quot;busy&quot;<br/>\nwith [i] something not done in RP or anywhere. But if you reveres the<br/>\ninstructions the problem now exists with &quot;bean&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Still it looks like Lexical set&#39;s are quite usable in a solution,<br/>\nperhaps as follows: map the 27 Wells sets to QS letters for each<br/>\naccent then summarize the result with an example word from that set (<br/>\npresumably the set name ). And if I put the lexical sets THOUGHT and<br/>\nLOT under the QS letter Ox while Kingsley puts THOUGHT under the QS<br/>\nletter Awe, we will still be able to communicate quite clearly, I promise.<br/>\n  So I suggest that the Lexical set mapping you posted be used only by<br/>\nRP English speakers and alternative ones must be made for other accents.</div>",
