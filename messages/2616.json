Most people don&#39;t pronounce &quot;sing&quot; as &quot;sing-g&quot;:<br/>\nexceptions are Birmingham, England, and Long Island, N.Y, where the<br/>\nlocal pronunciations are &quot;Birming-gum&quot; and &quot;Long Guyland&quot;.

It doesn&#39;t much matter, because once again there<br/>\nare no words which distinguish between #26 #21 and #27 #21.

Read writes the word<br/>\n&gt; &quot;marry&quot; with 30-25, which combo isn&#39;t used with my accent.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right, you pronounce &quot;marry&quot;, &quot;merry&quot;, and &quot;Mary&quot; all alike.  But<br/>\nEasterners don&#39;t, and neither do people outside North America, and<br/>\nSoutherners usually merge &quot;merry&quot; and &quot;Mary&quot; but distinguish<br/>\n&quot;marry&quot;.  To me, when you say any of these words, it sounds like<br/>\nyou are saying &quot;Mary&quot;, i.e. #29 #25.  For me, &quot;merry&quot; is #28 #25<br/>\nand &quot;marry&quot; is #30 25.  Orthodox spelling is a good guide here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I<br/>\n&gt; understand the correct pronunciation of letter 36 Utter, then the combo<br/>\n&gt; of 36-25 is not correct in words such as butter, early, girl, murder.<br/>\n&gt; When the two letters are pronounced individually in quick succession, it<br/>\n&gt; does not make the necessary sound for the above words, with my accent.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s a known deficiency in Quikscript, and you just have to get<br/>\nused to #36 #25.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 36-25 comes close, as well as 39-25, but neither do the job properly. I<br/>\n&gt; think this sound needs a completely new letter; I just use the letter 25<br/>\n&gt; turned backwards to signify this sound in my own writing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>An alternative is to just use #25 as a vowel.  If you say &quot;curd&quot;,<br/>\nfor example, there are really just three sounds in it:  #6 #25 #4.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, I believe that letters 35 OY, and 37 OUt<br/>\n&gt; are simply combination sound as well, and are perhaps unnecessary letters<br/>\n&gt; as a result.
