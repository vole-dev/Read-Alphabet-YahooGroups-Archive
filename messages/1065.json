It is<br>\n&gt; the successor to and has much in common with /with/ Shavian.<br>\n&gt; Authoritative documentation for it can be found in &Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&#8218;&not;&Aring;&#8220;The<br>\n&gt; QuikScript Alphabet&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&#8218;&not;&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;. [emphasis added]<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt; In the following paragraph under &quot;Alternate Forms,&quot; I suggest\nchanging<br>\n&gt; the word &quot;usually&quot; to &quot;highly&quot; since some letters can be properly<br>\n&gt; connected and some cannot.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt; Many letters have half height or alternate forms in order to help<br>\n&gt; speed up writing by reducing the number of strokes and pen lifts.<br>\n&gt; The half height and alternate forms are only used in\n&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&#8218;&not;&Euml;&#339;senior&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&#8218;&not;&acirc;&#8222;&cent;<br>\n&gt; QuikScript which is /usually/ cursive. [emphasis added]<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt; Whether a given writer decides to connect any letter to another is\nhis<br>\n&gt; choice, but I would consider it improper to extend or change the\nform<br>\n&gt; of a letter in order to make a connection to the next letter\npossible.<br>\n&gt; I believe the only exceptions approved by Read in the QS manual are<br>\n&gt; for the letters with alternate forms (N-o and U-tter) and for F-ee,<br>\n&gt; M-ay and TH-ey.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt; The alternate &quot;TH-ey&quot; extends the bottom of the letter upwards to\nthe<br>\n&gt; lower writing line to permit connection with the next letter. Read<br>\n&gt; terms this an &quot;allowable extension,&quot; but it seems to me it should\nbe<br>\n&gt; considered an alternate form and listed that way in the proposal.<br>\n&gt; While the end stroke of F-ee can also be extended to join the next<br>\n&gt; letter, that seems less important to me so, in my opinion, it\ncould be<br>\n&gt; left out of the proposal. Of course, others may feel that it\nshould be<br>\n&gt; included. I don&#39;t know how difficult it is to include these from a<br>\n&gt; technical standpoint. If we make provision for some alternate\nforms,<br>\n&gt; then adding a couple more is probably no big deal. In looking back\nat<br>\n&gt; the manual for the first time in a long time, I realize that I\nalmost<br>\n&gt; habitually use the alternate form of &quot;M-ay.&quot; The standard form\nseems a<br>\n&gt; little more difficult for me to write. That may be lack of\npractice or<br>\n&gt; it may have something to do with being left-handed.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt; I am confused about your list of letters presented as having<br>\n&gt; half-height forms. You list 15 such letters, but the QS manual\nlists<br>\n&gt; only P-ea, T-ea, H-e, D-ay, Z-oo, and W-ay. In addition to those, I<br>\n&gt; have used WH-y and Y-e for decades since they work as half-letters<br>\n&gt; just as well as the six Read suggested. I had actually forgotten\nthey<br>\n&gt; are not listed in the manual as half-letters until Jon Zuck\npointed it<br>\n&gt; out to me. Since it is clear what letters they are, it just made\nsense<br>\n&gt; to me. Besides, I love the way the half-letters contribute to the<br>\n&gt; variety of wordshapes possible in QS. However, you have added seven<br>\n&gt; more: F-ee, V-ie, S-ee, SH-e, J&#39;-ai, CH-eer, J-ay. I believe this\nis<br>\n&gt; incorrect. Can you explain how they can be used as half-height\nforms?<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt; I have never used the two &quot;x&quot; letters as they always struck me as<br>\n&gt; outside the spirit of QS -- 1 phoneme to 1 symbol. It was Read&#39;s<br>\n&gt; stated goal for &quot;x&quot; to &quot;compete&quot; with the TO &quot;x&quot; as if that was<br>\n&gt; necessary to avoid people deciding that QS was not viable because\nof<br>\n&gt; two instances where it took two QS symbols when only one was\nneeded in<br>\n&gt; TO.

It is in the manual,\nand I<br>\n&gt; guess that if it is coded, then people can choose whether to use\nit or<br>\n&gt; not.<br>\n&gt;<br>\n&gt; I&#39;m impressed with the rest of the proposal.

This would no doubt have been caught:&nbsp; new typo in Alternate Forms\nsec., 3d par. &quot;height&quot; mispelled - &quot;e&quot; missing.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n3.&nbsp; My suspicion is that the upper half of S-ee could easily be misread\nas an H-e or even a T-ea, if one&#39;s handwriting is sloppy or hurried.&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI have sat here trying Ch-eer as a half-height, and I don&#39;t care for\nit.&nbsp; After the initial hook, the pen-stroke is moving from right to\nleft as it descends and going from that directly into a vowel starting\nat the center writing line just doesn&#39;t seem to work very well to me.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI am comfortable with Y-e and Wh-y as half-heights since either of\nthese half-letters clearly cannot be anything else.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n4.&nbsp; Text of Alternate Forms sec. -- Should our desire to have the\nhalf-height and alternate forms available be explained more\neffectively?&nbsp; If our proposal states that their primary purpose is to\nincrease the speed of handwriting, the powers that be in Unicode may\nfeel these variants serve little purpose in computer-generated text. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn fact, I believe the half-height letters, as well as the alternate\nforms, will not only aid writing speed, but assist adept readers in\nreading faster since they produce more distinctive word-scapes as the\neye scans along the lines.&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n5.&nbsp; Variant Selectors -- can you explain how this would work?&nbsp; From\nwhat you have written, it seems that the font would normally select\nwhether a full letter or a half-letter or an alternate form would be\nused in a given context?&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; If so, how is that\nprogrammed into the font?&nbsp; For example, would the font know which form\nof &quot;n&quot; to use based on what letter precedes it?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPreviously, we have mapped these alternate forms and half height\nletters on to the keyboard so that we could choose when we wanted to\nuse them.&nbsp; My ignorance of how Unicode functions leaves me unclear how\nhaving QS encoded in Unicode would change this.&nbsp; Can you explain that?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI take it that the purpose of the variant selectors was to allow us to\noverride the font&#39;s programming if it was needed.&nbsp; Correct?&nbsp;&nbsp; But now\nthat seems unnecessary to you.&nbsp; Does that mean that you believe that\nhaving the flexibility to make the choice of half-letters or alternate\nforms ourselves doesn&#39;t seem important to try to include that in the\nproposal?&nbsp; Or you just believe the Unicode people, for some reason,\nwould not want that in the encoding of QS?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPaige&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\namd64_hacker wrote:\n&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;mid:46F6C305.1050303@...&quot;

alternate forms for the moment.&lt;br&gt;\nYou mentioned YE and WHY, I&#39;ve found SEE and CHEER to be quite&lt;br&gt;\nacceptable as half heights, are there any others?&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\nI&#39;m reasonably certain that adding extra alternate forms to Unicode&lt;br&gt;\nwould only be done during a revision to the standard (i.e. from 6.0 to&lt;br&gt;\n6.1 or 6.0 to 7.0).&lt;br&gt;\nRemoving alternate forms is impossible as far as I can see (for good&lt;br&gt;\nreasons).&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\nI&#39;m thinking of dropping the Variant Selectors from the proposal.&lt;br&gt;\nWe&#39;ll almost certainly be asked to drop them once it&#39;s submitted and I&#39;m&lt;br&gt;\nnot sure that I can see an argument to defend them with.&lt;br&gt;\nI originally thought that there may be occasions when it would be&lt;br&gt;\nnecessary to explicitly choose one form over another rather than letting&lt;br&gt;\nthe font choose for us.&lt;br&gt;\nFor example encoding the string: &quot;The senior form of &#39;&lt;VS1 +\nUTTER&gt;&#39; is&lt;br&gt;\n&#39;&lt;VS2 + UTTER&gt;&#39;.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\nBut the more I think about it the less use I can see for them.&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\nPaige Gabhart wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;

amd64_hacker:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Regarding your Unicode Proposal. First let me thank you for myself\nand&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the group for your willingness to put your effort and time into\nthis&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; for us all.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I had not found the time to look your proposal in detail\npreviously.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Here are my thoughts.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; First, a couple of minor things:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; At the beginning of the proposal, there is a duplicated &quot;with.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; A caseless, phonetic, left-to-right alphabet optimised for the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; English language (but still useful for other languages with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; similar sounds) created by (Ronald) Kingsley Read. It is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the successor to and has much in common with /with/ Shavian.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Authoritative documentation for it can be found in &Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&#8218;&not;&Aring;&#8220;The&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; QuikScript Alphabet&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&#8218;&not;&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;. [emphasis added]&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In the following paragraph under &quot;Alternate Forms,&quot; I suggest\nchanging&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the word &quot;usually&quot; to &quot;highly&quot; since some letters can be properly&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; connected and some cannot.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Many letters have half height or alternate forms in order to help&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; speed up writing by reducing the number of strokes and pen lifts.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The half height and alternate forms are only used in\n&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&#8218;&not;&Euml;&#339;senior&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&#8218;&not;&acirc;&#8222;&cent;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; QuikScript which is /usually/ cursive. [emphasis added]&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Whether a given writer decides to connect any letter to another is\nhis&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; choice, but I would consider it improper to extend or change the\nform&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of a letter in order to make a connection to the next letter\npossible.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I believe the only exceptions approved by Read in the QS manual are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; for the letters with alternate forms (N-o and U-tter) and for F-ee,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; M-ay and TH-ey.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The alternate &quot;TH-ey&quot; extends the bottom of the letter upwards to\nthe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; lower writing line to permit connection with the next letter. Read&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; terms this an &quot;allowable extension,&quot; but it seems to me it should\nbe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; considered an alternate form and listed that way in the proposal.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; While the end stroke of F-ee can also be extended to join the next&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; letter, that seems less important to me so, in my opinion, it\ncould be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; left out of the proposal. Of course, others may feel that it\nshould be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; included. I don&#39;t know how difficult it is to include these from a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; technical standpoint. If we make provision for some alternate\nforms,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; then adding a couple more is probably no big deal. In looking back\nat&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the manual for the first time in a long time, I realize that I\nalmost&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; habitually use the alternate form of &quot;M-ay.&quot; The standard form\nseems a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; little more difficult for me to write. That may be lack of\npractice or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; it may have something to do with being left-handed.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I am confused about your list of letters presented as having&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; half-height forms. You list 15 such letters, but the QS manual\nlists&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; only P-ea, T-ea, H-e, D-ay, Z-oo, and W-ay. In addition to those, I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; have used WH-y and Y-e for decades since they work as half-letters&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; just as well as the six Read suggested. I had actually forgotten\nthey&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; are not listed in the manual as half-letters until Jon Zuck\npointed it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; out to me. Since it is clear what letters they are, it just made\nsense&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to me. Besides, I love the way the half-letters contribute to the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; variety of wordshapes possible in QS. However, you have added seven&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; more: F-ee, V-ie, S-ee, SH-e, J&#39;-ai, CH-eer, J-ay. I believe this\nis&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; incorrect. Can you explain how they can be used as half-height\nforms?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I have never used the two &quot;x&quot; letters as they always struck me as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; outside the spirit of QS -- 1 phoneme to 1 symbol. It was Read&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; stated goal for &quot;x&quot; to &quot;compete&quot; with the TO &quot;x&quot; as if that was&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; necessary to avoid people deciding that QS was not viable because\nof&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; two instances where it took two QS symbols when only one was\nneeded in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; TO. Should &quot;x&quot; be included in the proposal. It is in the manual,\nand I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; guess that if it is coded, then people can choose whether to use\nit or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; not.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m impressed with the rest of the proposal. Thank you again for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; working on this.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Paige&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--------------000703020804050205010704--\r\n\n"
