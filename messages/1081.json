Though they appear <br/>\ncorrect in an HTML browser, one can&#39;t type it in directly in any program <br/>\nthat I know of. I wish I could type QS Unicode in a text editor like VIM <br/>\ninstead of having to used an RTF editor and then paste it into the <br/>\ndocument I need.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, I can write documents in HTML, format them with a print CSS <br/>\nstylesheet, and then convert them to PDF, which anyone can read, and <br/>\nwhich allows me to have a print copy in front of me. I prefer reading a <br/>\npiece of paper instead of a screen. So thanks amd64 for the hints, and <br/>\nthank you all who created the QS fonts.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul</div>",
