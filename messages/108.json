I had intended to work<br/>\n&gt; some more on it before posting<br/>\n&gt; it, but I have not found the time.  Since we are getting so many posts<br/>\n&gt; on remapping the keyboard and<br/>\n&gt; ways to go about that, I felt I should get my two cents in.

I<br/>\n&gt;    have no experience at this and was blissfully ignorant of the<br/>\n&gt; contortions people using<br/>\n&gt;    computers with other languages were having to deal with, but you have<br/>\n&gt; got me thinking<br/>\n&gt;    about it.  I also had not considered the needs of an individual who<br/>\n&gt; types in QS as<br/>\n&gt;    part of his job and who needs to develop as much speed as a typist in<br/>\n&gt; roman.  Of<br/>\n&gt;    course, we do not have anyone in that position now, but it makes<br/>\n&gt; sense if we go to the<br/>\n&gt;    trouble of remaping Jerome that we should make the new keyboard as<br/>\n&gt; efficient as<br/>\n&gt;    possible.  By the way, you are the only person I have actually<br/>\n&gt; communicated with that<br/>\n&gt;    has tried Dvorak.  My knowledge about it was totally academic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    After considering your post, I have attached in wordpad format a<br/>\n&gt; proposed remapping of<br/>\n&gt;    Jerome, which I believe is much more logical than what we have now<br/>\n&gt; and adopts some of<br/>\n&gt;    your suggestions.  The remainder of this post explains my thinking<br/>\n&gt; regarding this<br/>\n&gt;    remapping.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    It had not occurred to me to use another key (rather than &quot;shift&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; for the purpose of<br/>\n&gt;    producing all the letters needed for QS.  I guess I was still<br/>\n&gt; thinking along<br/>\n&gt;    typewriter lines.  (I did know that each key combination produces a<br/>\n&gt; binary code which<br/>\n&gt;    is at some point translated by (I assume a driver) into the<br/>\n&gt; appropriate character for<br/>\n&gt;    the output.)  It makes sense that it would be slightly faster to<br/>\n&gt; utilize a letter on<br/>\n&gt;    the home row rather than the &quot;shift&quot; key to specify an alternate<br/>\n&gt; character for a<br/>\n&gt;    particular key since it eliminates the need to move a finger off the<br/>\n&gt; home row.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    In effect what we require is similar to a function key on a<br/>\n&gt; scientific calculator,<br/>\n&gt;    which after it is activated, causes the regular keys to return a<br/>\n&gt; different output<br/>\n&gt;    after activation than their default output.  I have a scientific<br/>\n&gt; calculator which uses<br/>\n&gt;    two separate function keys which permits each regular key to serve<br/>\n&gt; three different<br/>\n&gt;    functions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Since there are fifteen (15) vowels in the QS alphabet and five (5)<br/>\n&gt; in the roman<br/>\n&gt;    alphabet, it seems to make sense for each roman vowel to be mapped to<br/>\n&gt; three (3)<br/>\n&gt;    different vowels in QS.  Therefore, we need to map two function keys<br/>\n&gt; for the left hand<br/>\n&gt;    and two function keys for the right hand just as we now have a right<br/>\n&gt; and left shift<br/>\n&gt;    key.  I propose that the left hand function keys be &quot;f&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, and<br/>\n&gt; the right hand<br/>\n&gt;    function keys be &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k.&quot;  This uses the forefinger and index<br/>\n&gt; finger of each hand<br/>\n&gt;    which for the average person are probably the two strongest and agile<br/>\n&gt; fingers on each<br/>\n&gt;    hand.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    I have mapped a, e, i, o and u with three QS vowels each.  The<br/>\n&gt; primary key by itself<br/>\n&gt;    returns the long vowel.  The primary key plus the opposite hand&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; forefinger, i.e. &quot;f&quot;<br/>\n&gt;    or &quot;j&quot; returns the short vowel, and the primary key plus the opposite<br/>\n&gt; hand&#39;s index<br/>\n&gt;    finger, i.e. &quot;d&quot; or &quot;k&quot; returns the final vowel, which is an<br/>\n&gt; additional vowel<br/>\n&gt;    generally associated with the roman vowel with the exception of the<br/>\n&gt; third vowel on the<br/>\n&gt;    &quot;i&quot; key.  (I guess no system is perfect.)  Since all QS vowels are<br/>\n&gt; mapped to the<br/>\n&gt;    standard five roman vowels, they should be fairly easy to learn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Again, for ease of learning, I placed the half-letters on the same<br/>\n&gt; keys as their<br/>\n&gt;    primary letters, and they are activated by pressing the forefinger of<br/>\n&gt; the opposite<br/>\n&gt;    hand at the same time.  &quot;Q&quot; remained unused, and it made sense to map<br/>\n&gt; it to wholewheat<br/>\n&gt;    and half-wholewheat as it was next to &quot;W&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    &quot;X&quot; remained unused so I mapped the two QS equivalents to that key.<br/>\n&gt; Now you can keep<br/>\n&gt;    both of them, Jon.  I assume the &quot;ks&quot; should be the primary key, and<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;gs&quot; would be<br/>\n&gt;    the secondary key obtained by simultaneous pressing of the opposite<br/>\n&gt; hand forefinger,<br/>\n&gt;    i.e. &quot;j.&quot;  I mapped alternate &quot;No&quot; to the &quot;n&quot; key, again with the<br/>\n&gt; secondary function<br/>\n&gt;    obtained by hitting it with &quot;f&quot;.  I mapped &quot;Inkling&quot; as the primary<br/>\n&gt; key for &quot;c&quot;, and<br/>\n&gt;    the secondary is the alternate form of &quot;Up&quot;.  The namer dot I mapped<br/>\n&gt; to the secondary<br/>\n&gt;    position for &quot;m&quot;.  This puts it next to the comma which seemed<br/>\n&gt; appropriate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    This covers everything except the following:  sh, ch, zh, th, dh and<br/>\n&gt; the alternate<br/>\n&gt;    form &quot;Other&quot;.  I followed your suggestion and mapped them as two<br/>\n&gt; letter combinations.<br/>\n&gt;    &quot;Other&quot; I mapped to &quot;xh&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Check out the attached file with its chart, and let me know your<br/>\n&gt; thoughts on this.
