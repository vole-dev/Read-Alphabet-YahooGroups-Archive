A while back there was talk<br/>\nabout a newsletter. An article talking about various correspondence<br/>\ngroups, which might also talk about dialects, would be very interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the discussion has gotten very technical, but I think a lot of will<br/>\ncome from it. It has expanded my understanding of language greatly, and <br/>\neven more so has helped me clarify my understanding of what QS is. But <br/>\nthough the discussion is technical, the explanation for most users <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to be. In fact, the clearest simplest explanations come <br/>\nfrom those with a very thorough, deep understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou seem to advocate a somewhat standard way of using QS. Read seems to <br/>\nbelieve that is how QS should be used. From your excerpt, he states that <br/>\nstandardization saves &quot;thought&quot; and makes it easier for everyone to <br/>\nread. (I hope I understand this quote right.) Though earlier I argued <br/>\nthat QS should allow users to express their dialects, such a use would <br/>\nultimately make QS less practical.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding your inability to post the documents to the Yahoo group, I <br/>\nthink that is a major shortcoming of Yahoo groups in general. But not <br/>\nonly does it limit the file size, it doesn&#39;t really provide for a good <br/>\nway to store files. I have started a project at sourceforge, an open <br/>\nsource site that hosts many very professional, high end projects such as <br/>\nOpen Office. I hope to make it a friendly place to find articles and <br/>\nother fiction written in QS, so you could always post your material there.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul</div>",
