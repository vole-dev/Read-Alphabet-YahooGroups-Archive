  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1804694808\">You are making Wells&#39;s article injustice if you think it&#39;s<br/>\nall about adapting English spelling to various ESL<br/>\nminorities&#39; pronunciations or abolishing all historical<br/>\nspellings.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe points out that smallish minorities&#39; pronunciations<br/>\ncan for the most part not be taken into account, but also<br/>\nthat any truly Pan-Anglophone spelling reform. He is in<br/>\nfavor of keeping post-vocalic r, which he hardly would<br/>\nhave done if he had been a hardliner in what he calls the<br/>\nminimalist camp. I think he makes a good and fair<br/>\nassessment of the implications of accent differences for<br/>\nspelling reform - a subject which has been hotly<br/>\ndiscussed in this group recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nWells also makes a good case for not distinguishing the<br/>\nlexical sets TRAP-FATHER-BATH (At-Ah in QS terminology) or<br/>\nLOT-THOUGHT-CLOTH (QS Ox-Awe). For all Read&#39;s genius when it<br/>\ncame to Utter-and-Ado he seems to have been overly home-<br/>\nblind and maximist concerning these lexical sets. I find Awe<br/>\nand Ah cumbersome to write, and would not shed a tear if<br/>\nthey were abolished, or used only to write foreign names.<br/>\n<br/>\nWells also considers not to distinguish STRUT-FOOT-GOOSE (QS<br/>\nUtter-Foot-Ooze) although he himself is less sure about<br/>\nthat. Read clearly knew what he was doing when deciding not<br/>\nto distinguish STRUT-About- commA or NURSE- lettER. For the<br/>\nmajority who have split STRUT- FOOT it certainty relieves<br/>\nmany uncertainties and thus anxieties.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing Wells doesn&#39;t address, but which is of utmost<br/>\nimportance in balancing minimalism and maximalism, is the<br/>\nbalancing of ease of encoding, or writing, against ease of<br/>\ndecoding, or reading. When writing it causes little trouble<br/>\nif a number of distinctions one makes in speech are lumped<br/>\ntogether, but when reading it makes trouble both if too many<br/>\ndistinctions one makes in speech are missing and if too many<br/>\ndistinctions one doesn&#39;t make are present. That&#39;s exactly<br/>\nthe problem with TO, which not only persists in making<br/>\ndistinctions that were lost before Shakespeare, or already<br/>\nin Latin or Old French in the case of loanwords, but also in<br/>\nnot making distinctions that have arisen since Shakespeare,<br/>\nthough distinguishing some of the latter in an Pan-<br/>\nAnglophone spelling might be of doubtful value, as mentioned<br/>\nabove, since their outcome varies across the English-<br/>\nspeaking world.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for sight-site-cite Read didn&#39;t design QS to make<br/>\ndistinctions nobody makes in speech, and rightly so. If we<br/>\ncan use &#39;make a sighting&#39; or &#39;make a citation&#39; to make<br/>\nourselves clear in ambiguous contexts when speaking we can<br/>\ndo so in writing too. To be sure any respelling based on the<br/>\nLatin alphabet might look funny for a lot of reasons, pace<br/>\nLatin and Romance loanwords in Norwegian or Turkish. Thats<br/>\none of the reasons I favor QS, the other being that it saves<br/>\nmuscular effort while preserving linearity.<br/>\n<br/>\n(You would find my foreign accent with undistinguished See-<br/>\nZoo and She-J&#39;ai, and with a pronunciation of &quot;mayor&quot; which<br/>\nis halfway to &quot;measure&quot; as funny as the Filipinos&#39;. I&#39;d<br/>\nnever dream of putting it up as a model for English<br/>\nspelling, but neither do I expect to see foreign accents<br/>\nridiculed by those who advocate spelling reform.
