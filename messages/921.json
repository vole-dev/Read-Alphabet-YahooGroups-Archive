  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1614293502\">The thread about a QS newsletter was listed under the subject of New <br/>\nMembers, which was unfortunate.  Therefore, I am changing the subject, <br/>\nand new posts about this topic should be under this subject line: <br/>\n&quot;Newsletter.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  There is the problem of posting in QS to Yahoo groups, which seems <br/>\nsomewhat problematical due to difficulties that different browsers have <br/>\nin displaying a QS font.  I am not that knowledgeable about what causes <br/>\nthese problems, but it has been evident that some browsers have more <br/>\nproblems than others.  Has anyone tested this?  If so, do you know which <br/>\nbrowsers work the best?  Besides the idea of a newsletter, if we could <br/>\npost more messages in QS, I am confident it would help everyone&#39;s <br/>\nreading ability.  There is an indisputable irony that on a site devoted <br/>\nto the spread and use of an improved English alphabet, the peculiarities <br/>\nof the internet as it has developed has insured that we continue to <br/>\nwrite in TO almost exclusively.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  I would expect that a newsletter would be uploaded to the <br/>\nRead_Alphabet site where it would remain available for future download.  <br/>\nHowever, I wonder if there is a practical way to distribute a newsletter <br/>\nmore broadly?  Should a download of a newsletter include a copy of the <br/>\nalphabet with truncated rules for use?  Or should a copy of the alphabet <br/>\nbe positioned next to the newsletter download so that those needing a <br/>\ncopy can easily obtain it?<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  What program should be used to produce a newsletter.  And what <br/>\nprogram would a person need to be able to open it?  Should it contain <br/>\njust printed news, or should photos with QS captions be included along <br/>\nwith other features.<br/>\n<br/>\n4)  How much material should a newsletter contain and how frequently <br/>\nshould it be produced?  If we produce material on a regular basis, we <br/>\nmight expect that people would become more interested if they saw text <br/>\nin the alphabet to read.  How can we expect to interest people in the <br/>\nalphabet if there is virtually nothing to read in it?<br/>\n<br/>\n5)  Just as in the open source paradigm, many people cooperate to <br/>\nproduce products that rival corporate offerings, if several of us work <br/>\ntogether, we should be able to produce a newsletter that would be <br/>\ninteresting for QS aficionados to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n6)  What topics should be covered?  As someone else wrote, I would think <br/>\nthat general interest stories would be best as there would not be enough <br/>\nnews about QS to produce a newsletter on any regular basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n7)  Copy for a newsletter cannot violate copyright laws.<br/>\n<br/>\n8)  This is farther afield, but it just popped into my head.  I assume <br/>\nthat a QS crossword puzzle in a newsletter should work fine, but TO <br/>\npuzzles are based on a &quot;proper&quot; spelling.  Since words spelled in QS are <br/>\nbased on the writer&#39;s pronunciation, an unusual pronunciation might make <br/>\nthe puzzle harder.  Of course, that could be considered part of the <br/>\ndifficulty of the puzzle.  It could mean that it would help to know <br/>\nwhere the puzzle-maker hails from.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, I am proficient about thinking up questions.  Anyone have any <br/>\nanswers or any other questions they would like to pose?  Anyone is <br/>\nwelcome to start their own thread under this general one about a newsletter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nPaige</div>",
