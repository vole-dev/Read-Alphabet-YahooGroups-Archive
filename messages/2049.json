I have read members&#39; QS \nwhose choice of vowels seem peculiar to me in certain words as they are \nnot the ones I would choose for that particular word.  Nevertheless, it \nhas rarely caused me more than a moment&#39;s confusion in reading.  It is \nmy firm conviction that the decrease in reading speed by letting people \nspell as they wish would be minimal.  That is a better solution than the \nburden that would be imposed on everyone by trying to mandate that words \nshould be spelt according to someone&#39;s idea of what is &quot;correct&quot; or \nsimplest for the largest number of speakers.  To me adopting spellings \nthat require people to once again learn a sound scheme or look words up \nputs up firmly back into the TO trap we are trying to escape from.  I \nbelieve it stems from the unfortunate desire for control and \nregularity.  If we let people just spell any old way, who knows what \nthey&#39;ll want to do next?\n\nMy feeling is that any attempt to enforce an arbitrarily determined \n&quot;standard&quot; no matter how well-intentioned, is doomed to failure.  \nEnglish-speaking people don&#39;t think that way.  We are not French -- we \nare not even German.  We have no language academy to enforce these \nthings and no interest in having one.\n\nI believe you are making a mountain out of a molehill here.  It is much \nsimpler to simply let people spell words in the manner that seems \nnatural to them.\n\nIn favor of limited anarchy, I remain.\n\nPaige\n\npeter_r_guinness wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;-- In Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:Read_Alphabet%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, John Cowan &lt;cowan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; peter_r_guinness scripsit:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; FORCE = 33 Awe + 25 Roe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; NORTH = 33 Awe + 25 Roe\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m now thinking that the small number of NORTH words should be\n&gt; written\n&gt; &gt; Owe + Roe rather than Awe + Roe, to accommodate people who do make\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; distinction: speakers in Scotland, Ireland, the Caribbean, and parts\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; the U.S.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Personally I don&#39;t think that we should make the distinction because\n&gt; the greater majority don&#39;t and that the spelt difference in\n&gt; pronunciation would cause confusion and seem odd to them.\n&gt; However, if instead we designed a symbol that looked similar to &#39;Awe&#39;\n&gt; but sounds as a NORTH set vowel than I would support making it\n&gt; optional since it wouldn&#39;t interfere much with the readability of a\n&gt; text for the bulk of readers.
