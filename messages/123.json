But what if you are\ntrying to type the word &quot;ahead.&quot;&nbsp; You need a schwa followed by an\n&quot;h,&quot; but the driver will interpret this as an &quot;Ah.&quot;&nbsp; Again, the idea\nof an &quot;undo&quot; character as I suggested above would&nbsp; solve this (if\nthat is technically feasible), or we need to map another letter combination\nfor &quot;Ah.&quot;&nbsp; I have not given much thought to the other proposed letter\ncombinations for these vowels, but I would not be surprised if they also\ncould give rise to unexpected results.\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know your thoughts on this.\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your work, Jon.\n&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;p&gt;Paige\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;blockquote TYPE=CITE&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Read_Alphabet-unsubscribe@egroups.com&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
