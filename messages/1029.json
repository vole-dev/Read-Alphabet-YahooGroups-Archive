I\n&gt;     suspect\n&gt;     &gt; that rapid silent reading and standardized orthography go together --\n&gt;     &gt; we do know that fluent readers recognize familiar words by the total\n&gt;     &gt; shape of the word, slowing down only when they must to read an\n&gt;     unfamilar\n&gt;     &gt; word, and that this is equally true in languages that are rationally\n&gt;     &gt; spelled, irrationally spelled, or not spelled at all (like Chinese).\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; So if QS is going to become important for works meant to be read\n&gt;     &gt; more than once (as opposed to shorthand/transcription uses), a\n&gt;     &gt; standardized orthography will have to evolve.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Which immediately leads to the issue of dialects. One&#39;s obvious and\n&gt;     &gt; natural phonetic orthography is another&#39;s stumbling block. (&quot;Hmm,\n&gt;     &gt; is it spelled &#39;theft&#39; or &#39;feft&#39;?&quot; &quot;Hmm, does this mean &#39;lord&#39; or\n&gt;     &gt; &#39;laud&#39;?&quot;) A universal orthography ends up needing to make more\n&gt;     &gt; distinctions\n&gt;     &gt; than any one dialect actually needs, and thus to some extent becoming\n&gt;     &gt; artificial to all.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; --\n&gt;     &gt; John Cowan cowan@... &lt;mailto:cowan%40ccil.org&gt; &lt;mailto:\n&gt;     cowan% &lt;mailto:cowan%25&gt;40ccil.org &lt;http://40ccil.org&gt;&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; &quot;Mr. Lane, if you ever wish anything that I can do, all you will have\n&gt;     &gt; to do will be to send me a telegram asking and it will be done.&quot;\n&gt;     &gt; &quot;Mr. Hearst, if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do\n&gt;     &gt; anything, you can put the telegram down as a forgery.&quot;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"
