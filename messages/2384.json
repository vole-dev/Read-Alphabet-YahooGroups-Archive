Shavian paved the way already and looking at fully adopted scripts on the site it becomes clear that it will most likely be accepted by simply adding the unique glyphs that Quikscript introduces.  Once that concept incubates a bit then the naming scheme of Shavian Quikscript makes sense (even though I would say it adds to the identity crisis).<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter this it becomes a matter of glyph matching to what already exists to find the unique ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above chain of thinking becomes more relevant evaluating PEA versus PEEP.  They look alike *and* sound alike.  There are subtle glyph variations allowed in Unicode such as U+0067 versus U+0261, but the latter came in as an IPA extension rather than  script.  For font purposes, the Quikscript version would simply accentuate the hook.<br/>\n<br/>\nUTTER and ADO match glyphs which would logically bind them both to U+10469.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the draft1 doc in Files, there are 28 glyphs to submit unique to QS including the PEA glyph.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com\">Read_Alphabet@yahoogroups.com</a>, oliver langan &lt;oliver@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was involved with one of the proposals for Quickscript Unicode standardization.
