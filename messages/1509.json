I would also like to use his spelling of the 70 most <br/>\ncommon words. Last, I would like to start using some, if not all, of <br/>\nRead&#39;s suggestions on common word endings, such as words ending in -ing <br/>\nand -ed. However, I cannot read many of these words because of Read&#39;s <br/>\nhand writing and my inexperience with QS. Plus, some of the letters <br/>\nappear to be the half letters of Senior QS, such as the the double Deed <br/>\nat the end of words.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor #1 and #2, I would like someone to submit the abbreviations as a <br/>\ntext attachment or in an email. In one column, put the TO word, and in <br/>\nthe next put the QS transcription.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor #3, I would like a list as in #1, with any explanation when to use <br/>\nthese ending, if it is not already clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some of these cases, it appears that Read recommends using senior QS <br/>\nletters, so should we try to use a Junior equivelent?<br/>\n<br/>\nThese contributions will help me make the news more readable.
