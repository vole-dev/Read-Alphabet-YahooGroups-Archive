(Graphemes are the characters and other symbols of a writing system-- but not the particular shape or sytle.  When you draw a letter such as an &quot;A&quot; you are drawing a glyph and not a grapheme-- the glyph is graphic rendering drawn with a particular style/font that represents a grapheme.  So a computer font is basically a mapping from graphemes to glyphs.).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if I give you a list of these unicode numbers you can then create a corresponding string of graphemes. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis allows computers know precisely which character symbol should be displayed in a written text.  The text is just stored as a list of these unicode numbers interspersed with formatting info-- this list of numbers corresponds to the list of graphemes which make up the wording of the text.  This list of numbers can be be converted to a series of glyphs by a computer that reads each number, looks up that number in the desired font and gets the corresponding glyph (shape and style of the graphic), it then scales and colours the glyph according the desired formatting and displays the graphic at the correct location on the screen. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe unicode standard was designed with future expansion in mind and so was made from the start to potentially handle *lots* of graphemes-- all the world&#39;s current symbols in all its traditional writing systems can fit comfortably into it with plenty of room left to spare.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause Quickscript is not a traditional alphabet it was never included formally into unicode-- however, the unicode people realised that there will be odd-ball and new alphabets like this and left aside room for them in a special area (ie: they left aside a range of numbers for these types of alphabets).  The ordering of alphabets in the area are not controlled by unicode-- its a free-for-all: anyone can place their own alphabet whereever they like in this area.  This means that some of these alphabets may collide with others--  there is a voluntary non-official group which sort-of polices this area and offers guidance/control where people should place their own alphabets.  (Indeed-- if I&#39;m not mistaken John Cowan of this group or formerly of this group-- don&#39;t know if he&#39;s still active-- has had a *lot* to do with maintaining the order in this region of unicode.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf QS alphabet is ever formerly accepted into unicode then it will be given its own unique special region with-in unicode.   No other alphabet will be ever be allowed to use this region.  This means that each grapheme of QS will be qiven exactly one unique number.  So that if one of these numbers ever appears in a text (where the text is unicode encoded) then the computer will know that it is a QS grapheme that is required to be drawn.<br/>\n<br/>\n What unicode *isn&#39;t*, is a mapping of keyboard keys to a graphemes.  The mapping of each key on your keyboard is completely independent of the unicode number of a grapheme-- this key board mapping can be changed at will by yourself whereas unicode is an international standard and cannot be changed except by the governing body (and it&#39;s a quite a process to change/add to unicode).  eg: there is nothing stopping you from mapping the key that you normally use to type a &quot;t&quot; to have it type a &quot;q&quot; instead-- each keyboard mapping is detailed in a file on your own computer- you are free to change it at will.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, many QS fonts *don&#39;t* use the QS unicode-- infact they are piggy-backed on top of the  latin character alphabet&#39;s unicode numbers.  This means that QS text is actually stored using the latin alphabet unicode numbers- however, the font that&#39;s being used maps these numbers to QS glyphs instead of the latin glyphs that are meant to be drawn.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Unicode is actually a bit more complicated then this and contains other info besides just raw mapping of graphemes.  eg: some of the world&#39;s writing systems actually have different ways of drawing the same letter of a word depending on what other letters are surrounding it so unicode has extra details/mechanisms to handle such systems.(indeed-- Quikscript is one such system-- the senior script letters change depending on which character comes before and/or after).</div>",
