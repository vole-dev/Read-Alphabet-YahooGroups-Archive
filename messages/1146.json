  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1014338295\">If I may weigh in, I know its rather a large thing to bring up but my<br/>\nonly concern is that we may want rethink our coverage of Senior<br/>\nQuickScript in the Unicode proposal. I say this with immense<br/>\nreluctance since Senior is my particular joy but I have several<br/>\nreasons never the less: <br/>\n<br/>\n1. The set of glyphs included in the current Unicode proposal omits a<br/>\nlarge number critical variations necessary for Senior QS (one example:<br/>\nthe way &quot;Roe&quot; attaches to following &quot;Ice&quot;. Another example: the &quot;Roe&quot;<br/>\n+ &quot;Zoo&quot; which is found in rendering Mrs. ). Being limited to this<br/>\nreduced Senior QS set results in writing that is neither Senior nor<br/>\nJunior but an undocumented and inconsistent hybrid which I suggest we<br/>\ndo not wish to permanently embed in the Unicode standard.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. From what I have read, Junior was intended to be used for<br/>\ntypographic purposes and Senior was not. Although this decision was no<br/>\ndoubt made in an era of typewriters and manual typesetting, even now<br/>\nthe TrueType font rendering specification (anchors and scripts et al),<br/>\nare inadequate to properly render Senior.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my humble opinion, I suggest removing those glyphs which try to<br/>\nsupport Senior QS and proceed with a purely Junior QS set of glyphs<br/>\nuntil the considerable Senior QS requirements are full described.<br/>\nPersonally I would desperately like to see Senior QS in the Unicode<br/>\nstandard  and would love to contribute as much as I can to such a<br/>\nproposal if you think it appropriate. Indeed, I have made fair headway<br/>\nin locating the needs for Senior QS and I would enthusiastically post<br/>\nwhat I have found if you believe it will be of use but I can not claim<br/>\nit is complete yet.</div>",
