  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-150808190\">I know we have not reached an agreement on how to deal with mergers, <br/>\nexcept that each person use the same vowel consistently. This has led to <br/>\nsome funny looking words for me, such as &quot;bomb&quot; appearing &lt;qs&gt;bYm&lt;/qs&gt; <br/>\nSeeing the word spelled with Ah rather than Awl or On made it hard to <br/>\nrecognize. I was so sure it was a mistake in the CMU dictionary, that I <br/>\nlooked it up in my Longman&#39;s dictionary, and listed the pronunciation as <br/>\nAh. (Longman&#39;s merges Ah and On.) Since I don&#39;t merge Ah and On like <br/>\nother Americans, seeing &quot;bomb&quot; spelled this way just seems wrong, &quot;bomb&quot; <br/>\nis pronounced with a much different vowel than &quot;father.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurred to me that I should build my dictionary by not merging Awl, <br/>\nOn, and Ah. If I see &quot;bomb&quot; spelled with &quot;On,&quot; I would not be surprised. <br/>\nIf mid-Western American sees &quot;bomb&quot; spelled with On, he would also not <br/>\nbe the least bit surprised. Even if he merges Awl, Oh, and Ah, he will <br/>\njust recognized On as another way of saying what he recognizes as Ah or <br/>\nAwl. The letters to him will be interchangeable. On the other hand, if a <br/>\nBritish person sees &quot;bomb&quot; spelled with On, he will also not be <br/>\nsurprised, but he would be if it were spelled with &quot;Ah.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo by keeping the Awl Ah On merger separate, I make the news easier to <br/>\nread for a greater number of people. This seems a short term, workable <br/>\nsolution to one merger. At the same time, I don&#39; think any other mergers <br/>\nwill come into play on the same scale as On-Awl-Ah.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it means for me is that I will have to look up words like &quot;bomb&quot; in <br/>\nmy Heritage dictionary (which does not merge Ah and On) or at <br/>\ndictionary.com. At the same time, I could look up the words in a British <br/>\ndictionary. I can then enter the words in my checked dictionary, and <br/>\ncontinue to build this dictionary in a way that will make it more usable <br/>\nto a larger number of people, rather than having others re-do a lot of <br/>\nmy word.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn his article on spelling reform, Wells makes the following distinction:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Logically there are two extreme positions one can adopt towards <br/>\nphonemic contrasts. The maximalist position would say our orthography <br/>\nmust reflect all the contrasts that anyone makes, and the minimalist <br/>\nposition would say we should reflect only those that everyone makes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose for the purpose of the Ah-Awl-On merger, I am taking somewhat <br/>\nof a maximalist position. That is, I think it better to have text that <br/>\naccomodates this distinction, since a great number of English speakers <br/>\n(though probably not the majority) do make this distinction.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul</div>",
