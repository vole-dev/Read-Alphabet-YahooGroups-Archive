  "messageBody": "<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1795971489\">Hi Paul,<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the scope of the dictionary you plan to create? If you want to<br/>\ninclude accents from the UK, for instance, I expect you&#39;ll need<br/>\nsources other than the CMU Dictionary. If you&#39;ve found suitable<br/>\nsources for non-North American accents, please let us know.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch a dictionary would be a valuable resource for the accents it<br/>\nrepresents accurately. It could drive applications that alter QS<br/>\noutput on the fly based on a user&#39;s choice of accent, for example.<br/>\nThat would be cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the internal representation that you choose to use in the<br/>\ndictionary doesn&#39;t really matter. In the end you&#39;re going to display<br/>\nQS, so any notation will do. The QS-SAMPA proposal has a different<br/>\npurpose. It aims to provide a single standard for two things: (1) a<br/>\nkeyboard layout that font developers can follow, and (2) a plain-text<br/>\nformat that allows the easy exchange of QS text in email and other<br/>\nsoftware applications.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor these purposes, we need a one-to-one correspondence between the<br/>\nletters of the Read Alphabet and the ASCII notation we use to<br/>\nrepresent them. Otherwise, something typed in plain text will be<br/>\nambiguous without another layer of information.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m happy to debate the relative merits of the different proposals for<br/>\nan ASCII notation for the Read Alphabet. So far, I think we can count<br/>\nat least four or five. Unsurprisingly, I still like QS-SAMPA best.<br/>\n<br/>\nTed<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Dec 13, 2007 10:42 AM, Paul Tremblay &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:phthenry@...\">phthenry@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am proposing a new way to assign ASCII letters that is a compromise<br/>\n&gt;  between the SAMPA proposal and my proposal, and which will hopefully<br/>\n&gt;  make things clearer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I don&#39;t think we should accept the SAMPA encoding as the default, since<br/>\n&gt;  it forces users to forgo some natural pairs. Specifically, for years all<br/>\n&gt;  of us<br/>\n&gt;  have have typed &quot;y&quot; for the sound in Yes [j], &quot;j&quot; for the sound in<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;judge&quot; [dZ], and &quot;I&quot; for the proper pronoun [aI]. I can&#39;t accept giving<br/>\n&gt;  up such an obvious keyboard mapping simply because SAMPA, a tool for<br/>\n&gt;  linguists, and seemingly based on European languages in general rather<br/>\n&gt;  than English specifically, says so. So I think we should adopt a<br/>\n&gt;  standard for ASCII based on what is easiest for English speakers to use<br/>\n&gt;  and remember. SAMPA is no more a standard for QS than the meter is for<br/>\n&gt;  measuring the volume of water.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  It has occurred while editing a dictionary for QS that I needed to<br/>\n&gt;  encode my words in lexical sets rather than the representations for QS<br/>\n&gt;  letters. For example, the dictionary I am using has _bore_ represented<br/>\n&gt;  as [kU@r]. It took me a while to realize that the [U@r] belonged to the<br/>\n&gt;  lexical set CURE. I had edited over 3,000 words when I became certain of<br/>\n&gt;  this, and many of those words I used the letters Wool + Ado + Roar.<br/>\n&gt;  Probably the Ado does not belong, so I have to go back and change a lot<br/>\n&gt;  of words.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  It would have been simpler for me to encode the word boor as such:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  boor b-CURE<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  where the words on the left is the TO word, and the word on the right is<br/>\n&gt;  the transliteration. Now when it comes time to finalize the dictionary,<br/>\n&gt;  I can simply replace all instances of -CURE with whatever QS letters we<br/>\n&gt;  decided were appropriate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  There are a lot of such instances where I am making decisions on what<br/>\n&gt;  letters to use, thereby losing information that I may want later, and<br/>\n&gt;  which I cannot retrieve except by going back and re-editing 80,000<br/>\n&gt;  words. For example, I have been removing the unstressed vowels before<br/>\n&gt;  _r_ in words like _better_. It would be better if I had entered the word<br/>\n&gt; as:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  better b-DRESS-t-LETTER<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Later I can decide if I want to change LETTER to /ar/ or just to /r/.<br/>\n&gt;  The same is true of the _y_ endings at the end of words, such as Betty.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  betty b-DRESS-t-HAPPY<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  We can decide later if we want HAPPY to become /i/ or /I/.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  My proposal states that we assign a letter to each lexical set, rather<br/>\n&gt;  than each QS letter. In practice, we mostly do this, but we completely<br/>\n&gt;  ignore some important lexical sets and merge others. We should keep the<br/>\n&gt;  same letters that John originally suggested, the ones based on SAMPA.<br/>\n&gt;  Thus, /i/ still becomes Eat, part of the FLEECE lexical set. In an<br/>\n&gt;  email, the convention of using John&#39;s SAMPA mapping still would more or<br/>\n&gt;  less hold, with the exception that we think of the letters as<br/>\n&gt;  representing lexical sets rather than actual letters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  In practice, _dress_ becomes /drEs/, the same as it was. We can still<br/>\n&gt;  paste that into a word processor, choose ThothSampa, and get a good QS<br/>\n&gt;  representation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  But the word _bird_ would become /bDd/, where D represents the NURSE<br/>\n&gt;  lexical set. We should no longer think in terms of ligatures, which are<br/>\n&gt;  just a typographical convention, but in terms of lexical sets, so that<br/>\n&gt;  the /D/ in this case should be as much as the standard as /E/.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  This means that the font ThothSampa would have to be changed slightly.<br/>\n&gt;  First, I would like to change the name to ThothLexical, a small change.<br/>\n&gt;  More importantly, I would need to make sure there is a sensible<br/>\n&gt;  representation for some of the lexical sets not yet represented, such as<br/>\n&gt;  Happy /K/. That means just letting the key &quot;K&quot; represent Eat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Here is the full mapping proposal, with lexical sets, or pseudal lexical<br/>\n&gt;  sets, on the left and the letter to represent them on the right. The<br/>\n&gt;  comments come after the &quot;#&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Paul<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  PS One other advantage of using lexical sets in this way is that it can<br/>\n&gt;  handle some of the mergers better. If I have all the BATH words<br/>\n&gt;  separated from the PATH words (admitedly not an easy task), I can choose<br/>\n&gt;  one vowel for a British transliteration and one for an American<br/>\n&gt;  transliteration.
