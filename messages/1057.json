It looked <br>as if Google docs had such a service permitting documents to be uploaded \n<br>and then viewed by members approved to see them.  I thought that pdf <br>would be an effective way to upload these scanned handwritten letters so <br>I checked the googel docs site, and it stated that pdf was one of the \n<br>formats they use.  So I then handwrote a letter, which was two pages <br>long, scanned it, saved it in pdf form, put it through PDF.995, which is <br>a free program which combined the two pages into a single document, and \n<br>then went to google docs, registered and attempted to upload the pdf <br>file.  It was at this point after going to their user forums that I <br>discovered that you can only _download_ pdf files, not _upload_ them.  I \n<br>love sites that don&#39;t make it clear what their restrictions are!<br><br>We could upload these letters to the group site, but how do we control <br>who adds to them and when or does it make a difference.  Also, <br>\nYahoogroups limits our files saved on their server to 100mb.  We could <br>just send the pdf file as an attachment in an e-mail to the people <br>interested in the reading practice.  If we had a list of the people <br>interested, I could send my letter to the first person on the list, who \n<br>then adds their letter to it (again, using PDF.995 to combine the pdf <br>files), and forwards it to the next person on the list.<br><br>Is there another format that would be more compact than pdf and/or work <br>better for what we are trying to accomplish?\n<br><br>Any comments, ideas, suggestions?<br><br>Paige<br><br></pre>\n\n\n<p></p>\n    </div>  \n\n    \n    <span style=\"color:white;\"></span>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><br><br clear=\"all\"><br>-- <br>Check out Ziphen Central!<br>Weekly posts on interesting and unique topics.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ziphen.benjaminbruce.com\">http://ziphen.benjaminbruce.com</a>\n</div>",
