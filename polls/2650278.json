Some proposals also include the eight half-letters. In order to be considered, the proposals were required to assign all free-standing Quickscript letters to upper case or lower case Roman letters. (There are not enough letters in the Roman alphabet to maintain this requirement for all of the half-letters.) Since the Jerome keyboard map does not meet this requirement, and proposals for a minimal update of the Jerome map gained no support in group discussion, it is not included among the final candidates. \n\nThis poll will close at the end of February 2008.\n\nThank you for voting!\n\nTed Larson Freeman",
