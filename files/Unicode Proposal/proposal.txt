QuikScript Unicode Proposal.

What is QuikScript?

	A caseless, phonetic, left-to-right alphabet optimised for
	the English language (but still useful for other languages
	with similar sounds) created by (Ronald) Kingsley Read.
	It is the successor to and has much in common with Shavian.
	Authoritative documentation for it can be found in “The
	QuikScript Alphabet”.

	QuikScript has 44 letters, of which 40 are ‘core’ letters,
	2 are labour saving ‘x’ letters and 2 letters are for handling
	words with Celtic origins.

	The 44 letters in order of their introduction in “The QuikScript
	Alphabet” are:

	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER PEA
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER BAY
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER TEA
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER DAY
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER KEY
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER GAY
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER THAW
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER THEY
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER FEE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER VIE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER SEE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER ZOO
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER SHE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER J'AI
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER CHEER
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER JAY
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER YE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER WAY
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER HE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER WHY
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER ING
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER MAY
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER NO
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER LOW
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER ROE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER IT
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER EAT
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER ET
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER EIGHT
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER AT
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER I
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER AH
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER AWE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER OX
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER OY
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER UTTER
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER OUT
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER OWE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER FOOT
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER OOZE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER LOCH
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER LLAN
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER EXCITE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER EXAMINE

	There are also 3 punctuation glyphs, a naming dot which
	is used to identify proper nouns and a pair of parenthesis
	which serve the same functions as U+0028 LEFT PARENTHESIS
	and U+0029 RIGHT PARENTHESIS but are more angular to help
	distinguish them in text.

	Since U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT is already established as a naming
	dot the only characters which need to be encoded are the 2
	parenthesis:

	QUIKSCRIPT LEFT PARENTHESIS
	QUIKSCRIPT RIGHT PARENTHESIS

Presentation and Alternate Forms

	There are two writing styles used with QuikScript text,
	‘junior’ and ‘senior’.

	In junior QuikScript each glyph is isolated from its neighbours
	and has no effect on their presentation.

	Senior QuikScript is highly cursive and employs half height
	letters and alternate forms in order to speed up writing
	by reducing the number of strokes and pen lifts.

	Junior QuikScript can be used for either proportionally spaced
	or mono spaced text. Senior QuikScript should only be used with
	proportionally spaced text.

	Since the meaning of a letter isn't altered by its form the
	choice of glyph to use for a letter is a matter of personal
	preference. On rare occasions it may be beneficial to be able
	encode a specific form.

	Assigning two variation selectors to choose between normal and
	half height/alternate forms would meet this need.

	The following letters have half-height forms:

	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER PEA
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER TEA
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER DAY
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER ZOO
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER WAY
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER HE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER YE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER WHY

	The following letters have alternate forms:

	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER THEY
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER MAY
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER NO
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER UTTER

Current Encodings and Issues.

	Currently there are two methods for storing QuikScript data.

	The most common method is to use a font with the printable ASCII
	characters mapped to QuikScript Glyphs.

	This unfortunately means that mixing Basic Latin and QuikScript
	is impossible in situations where raw (not marked up) text must
	be used.  For example in file names, title bars or in URLs.
	It also has the side effect of making processing very difficult,
	it is difficult to determine without user supplied hints
	which words are made of Latin characters and which are made of
	QuikScript characters.

	Recently an encoding using the PUA has been developed, this
	system allows for mixed Latin and QuikScript.

	This solution works for the most part but still suffers from
	the same problems as the first method if another font has Glyphs
	assigned to same code points.

Collation

	There is no accepted collation method for QuikScript currently.
	The 40 core letters are numbered and can therefore be arranged
	alphabetically, the remaining 4 letters have no number assigned
	to them.  In absence of a number it would be sensible to sort
	these letters after the core 40 in order they were introduced
	in “The QuikScript Alphabet”.

Overlap with Shavian

	Since QuikScript and Shavian are both phonic alphabets the way
	a letter sounds is perhaps more important than how it looks, we
	would like to keep the phonic information associated with each
	code point if at all possible.	This means that any candidates
	for merging in QuikScript and Shavian have to have both the same
	phoneme and the same glyph.

	There are 17 letters which are candidates for merging:

	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER DAY	U+1045B SHAVIAN LETTER DEAD
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER KEY	U+10452 SHAVIAN LETTER KICK
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER SEE	U+10455 SHAVIAN LETTER SO
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER ZOO	U+1045F SHAVIAN LETTER ZOO
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER SHE	U+10456 SHAVIAN LETTER SURE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER CHEER	U+10457 SHAVIAN LETTER CHURCH
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER JAY	U+10461 SHAVIAN LETTER JUDGE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER WAY	U+10462 SHAVIAN LETTER WOE
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER ING	U+10459 SHAVIAN LETTER HUNG
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER ROE	U+1046E SHAVIAN LETTER ROAR
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER IT	U+10466 SHAVIAN LETTER IF
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER ET	U+10467 SHAVIAN LETTER EGG
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER AT	U+10468 SHAVIAN LETTER ASH
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER OX	U+1046A SHAVIAN LETTER ON
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER OWE	U+10474 SHAVIAN LETTER OAK
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER FOOT	U+1046B SHAVIAN LETTER WOOL
	QUIKSCRIPT LETTER OOZE	U+10475 SHAVIAN LETTER OOZE

Proposal 1

	A new 48 block assigned in plane 1 containing the 44 QuikScript
	letters in the order they are introduced in “The QuikScript
	Alphabet”, followed by the left and right QuikScript
	parenthesis.

	Reuse U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT for the naming dot.

	Assign U+FE00 VARIATION SELECTOR-1 to force the selection of
	a full or normal form (junior) glyph during rendering.

	Assign U+FE01 VARIATION SELECTOR-2 to force the selection of
	a half or alternate form (senior) glyph during rendering.

	Assign the four letter script code ‘quik’.

Proposal 2

	A new 32 block assigned in plane 1 containing the 27 QuikScript
