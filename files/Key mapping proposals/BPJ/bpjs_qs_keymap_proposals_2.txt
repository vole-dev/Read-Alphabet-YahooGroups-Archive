  Benct Philip Jonsson's Quikscript key mapping
  proposal No. 1

The main innovation in my proposal lies in the mapping of
vowel letters, where I've tried to provide memory cues which
work in terms of the inner structure of Quikscript itself: I
wanted my mapping to make sense primarily in terms of the
observed systematic relations between Quikscript letter
shapes and values as mapped by Read, and secondarily by
recurring relations between Quikscript and Traditional
Orthography spellings. This mapping is meant to be a
transcription *of Quikscript* rather than any phonemic or
phonetic transcription system, which may be 'external' to
Quikscript. When using this mapping one will have to think
in terms of Quikscript letter shapes and letter relations.
This is meant to be an advantage in that one will 'think
Quikscript' when typing in this transcription, which will
hopefully be of help both to those who are used to write (as
opposed to type) in Quikscript in learning to type with this
mapping, and to those who are going to learn to write and
type Quikscript simultaneously.

   'Paired' vowel letter mappings

Of the fifteen Quikscript vowel letters fourteen form pairs
of related shapes, and Read clearly endeavored to map
related sounds to the letters within each pair. The six
'lax' or 'checked' vowel[^1] phonemes of Read's
conservative RP English[^2] were each mapped a letter
within one of these pairs — the one without an extra loop
in in the four cases where the difference between the
paired letters consists of such a loop —, while the other
letter of each pair has been mapped to a similar-sounding
'tense' vowel or diphthong. Five of the six RP 'lax' vowel
phonemes are readily associated with five of the six vowel
letters of Traditional Orthography, and thus the Quikscript
letters for those phonemes have been mapped to the
lowercase forms of their associated Traditional Orthography
letters: #26 = {i}, #28 = {e}, #30 = {a}, #34 = {o}, #39 =
{u}, and the sixth RP 'lax' vowel phoneme represented by
Quikscript letter #36 — which is paired with a 'looped'
letter #37 — has been mapped to the sixth Traditional
Orthography vowel letter {y}.

Next we map the Quikscript letters which are paired with the
Quikscript letters for the 'lax' vowels to the corresponding
Traditional Orthography uppercase vowel letters. Some of
these mappings make no 'phonetic' sense; rather one has to
remember the mapping of lowercase Traditional Orthography
vowel letters to Quikscript letters, and then the rule that
the Quikscript letters paired with these letters are mapped
to the corresponding Traditional Orthography uppercase
letters: #27 = {I}, #29 = {E}, #31 = {I}, #35 = {O}, #37 =
{Y}, #40 = {U}.

   Some problematic mappings

We then come to the seventh Quikscript vowel letter pair #32-
#33. They are problematic, since there are no Traditional
Orthography vowel letters readily available for them. I
choose to map them to the one Traditional Orthography upper-
lowercase letter pair not readily associated with any
English phoneme, namely {Q}-{q}. This does not mean that
there are no memory cues available for these mappings: #33
can be seen as a shape variation of #34, and the Traditional
Orthography uppercase _Q_ is of course visually similar to a
Traditional Orthography uppercase _O_, and, likewise #32 can
be seen as a shape variation of #30, and Traditional
Orthography lowercase _q_ is — admittedly vaguely —
similar to a Traditional Orthography lowercase script _a_.

Last we come the unpaired Quikscript vowel letter #38. It's
sound is usually associated with the Traditional Orthography
letter _o_, or one of the digraphs _oa, ou_ or _ow_ which
all contain _o_, but due to my choosen system for maping the
'paired' Quikscript vowel letters to ASCII letters {o} and
{O} are already occupied by Quikscript letters #34-#35. #38
must therefore be mapped to the otherwise unused Traditional
Orthography uppercase letter _B_, which at least allows us
to use the words "bowl" and "bow" (the noun), which recall
the shape of the letter in the Quikscript Manual, as memory
cues. I readily admit, however that this is the weakest
point of my proposal: if one finds the system for maping the
other vowels an advantage in favor of my proposal one will
simply have to take this weakness in the bargain! It was
tempting to map #38 to the ASCII `@` symbol, but I preferred
to map all the Quikscript letters which are sanctioned by
the Quikscript Manual to Traditional Orthography upper- or
lowercase letters leaving the ASCII symbol characters alone,
and the namer dot to the 'backtick' {\`} which is
superfluous in normal typing, pace TeX.

   Consonants

There are few innovations among the primary consonants,
since the majority of Quikscript consonant letters have an
obvious one-to-one counterpart in Traditional Orthography.
Most of the remaining Quikscript consonant letters have been
mapped them to the uppercase version of the letters for the
most similar sounds already mapped to a lowercase letter,
and I think few will argue against the mappings #7 = {T}, #8
= {D}, #13 = {S}, #14 = {Z}, nor with the mapping of #15 to
lowercase {c}, where the added complication of having to
press the shift key seemed unwarranted, despite the apparent
regularity of uppercase corresponding to an added _h_ in
Traditional Orthography. One might have preferred mapping
#13 to ASCII uppercase {C} and #14 to ASCII uppercase {J},
but the system of vowel mappings has already preempted the
pair {y}-{Y} for use as vowels, so that ASCII lowercase {j}
had to be mapped to #17, making it necessary to map #16 to
ASCII uppercase {J}, in spite of this being a step away from
native speakers' and writer's intuitions about Traditional
Orthography letter-to-sound correspondances. At least it
agrees with the old Quikscript font mapping.

The remapping — in fact swapping of the mappings — of
{G} and {N} may be a cause for concern for those used to
'traditional' Quikscript fonts, but I think it is warranted:
the Traditional Orthography spelling _ng_ at least contains
a _g_, while words like _now, knack, knife, need_ — the
the Quikscript Manual examples of initial alternate #23 —
don't, making transcriptions like {loGiG, NY, Nak, NAf, NId}
more readibly recognizable than {loNiN, GY, Gak, GAf, GId}.
I'm prepared to back down on this point, however.

  Benct Philip Jonsson's Quikscript key mapping
  proposal No. 2

   A more 'intuitive' mapping for _y_ and _u_

I have been considering a different arrangement which would
allow the mapping of #17 to ASCII lowercase {y} and other
differences which would allow memory cues which are perhaps
more intuitive in terms of native speakers' and writers'
expectations of Traditional Orthography sound-to-letter
correspondences, including the well-nigh universal
inclination to map #36 to lowercase {u}.

These changes do in fact amount to a different proposal,
since it no longer includes the 'Quikscript-internal'
'paired' vowel letter mappings. People may find it
attractive in spite of the fact that it will constitute a
compromise between an ASCII transliteration *of
Quikscript* and yet another quasi-phonemic ASCII
transcription of English.

   Quikscript-ASCII as a transliteration

Any mapping of Quikscript letters to ASCII letters will in
effect be a transliteration, and as such it must be easy
to read even if displayed in a normal ASCII font rather
than a Quikscript font, because there will be times, more
or less frequent, when we will be reading transcribed text
without having the time or opportunity to view it in a
Quikscript font.

   The signalling function of capitalization

The more I think of it the more convinced I get that in an
ASCII mapping of Quikscript the ASCII lowercase letters
should as far as possible be mapped to their regular
Traditional Orthography sounds - say their sounds as they
would say when teaching spelling in school - while the ASCII
uppercase letters should be used to signal their own
otherness.

   Other vowel mappings

    The lowercase ASCII vowel letters

For that reason the five lowercase vowel letters _i, e, a,
o, u_ should be mapped to #26, #28, #30, #34, #36, _j_ and
_y_ to #16 and #17 and so on for all the Traditional
Orthography single letters which have a default phoneme
correspondence.

    The ASCII uppercase vowel letters

Once the system of marking Quikscript paired vowels with
capitalization has been abandoned by the remapping of {u}
and {y} there is no point in keeping ASCII {A, O, Y} for
#31, #35, #37; indeed these mappings become more misleading
than the old uppercase {F} for #31, since people will expect
them to be mapped to vowels, but these sounds are never
written with these Traditional Orthography letters, unlike
_I_ and _E_ which at least map to the sounds of #27 and #29
in recent french loans like _machine_ and _ballet_. It
becomes better to use uppercase {Y} for #31, since this
letter and sound are associated in Traditional Orthography
(_my, rye, edify, hyphen_). It is also obviously better to
map ASCII uppercase {A} to #32, since this sound is always
written _a_ in accents like RP which maintain the three-way
contrast between #32, #33, #34. In the same vein ASCII
uppercase {O} can be conveniently mapped to #38, which is
'the long sound of _o_' in Traditional Orthography. For #33
we will map uppercase {Q} also in this mapping, if onlu
because we will need to map _Q_ to some Quikscript letter,
and at least uppercase {Q} looks like uppercase {O} with a
squiggle, just like #33 looks like #34 with a squiggle!

    Quikscript vowel letters mapped to ASCII consonant
    letters.

This will leave ASCII {q} as the odd man out among the ASCII
lowercase letters; I have mapped it to #35, not only because
it is the old mapping, but also because lowercase _q_ does
have some similarity, to the Quikscript letter itself — a
loop with a downwards tail to the right — as well as to
the Traditional Orthography digraph _oy_.

With lowercase {u} mapped to #36 some other ASCII letter
must be found for #39, and after some consideration I have
come to the conclusion that uppercase {V}, as proposed by
Ted Larson freeman, is indeed the best choice: it looks
similar to the Quikscript letter, and historically the
Traditional Orthography letters _U_ and _V_[^3] were variant
forms of the same letter.

ASCII uppercase {B} will still be mapped to a vowel, and
now memory-cued to the word "bout", and probably those who
are familiar with the _&#x0223;_ ligature form of the _ou_
digraph will be aided by its visual similarity to
uppercase _B_.

I choose to map ASCII uppercase {C} to alternate #36, since
Ted Larson Freeman brought the graphic similarity between
these letters of the two alphabets to attention, and with
{V} mapped to #39 no other of the available uppercase letter
fits better. That uppercase {C} is more readable than
lowercase in this role, especially next to {k}, because
capitalization serves to signal that C does not have any of
the usual sound values of Traditional Orthography c, nor,
indeed, marks a vowel is easily seen by comparing the
following:

|{C}=#36, {c}=#15|{C}=#15, {c}=#36|
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------
|{skClpcur}        | {skclpCur}       |_sculpture_
|{akCmpliS}        | {akcmpliS}       |_accomplish_
|{surkCs}          | {surkcs}         |_circus_
|{rukCs}           | {rukcs}          |_ruckus_
|{kClcurCl}        | {kclCurcl}       |_cultural_
|{kCstCm}/{kCsFCm} | {kcstcm}/{kcsFcm}|_custom_

There are, not counting derivations, some 30 words where #5
and #15 occur next to each other[^4], but I deem these to be
of far less text frequency than in particular the
combinations #36+#24 and #36+#22, espescially if one
considers that several of these words have alternative
pronunciations with #3+#17 instead of #15, and thus should
perhaps be spelled accordingly.

   Consonant mappings

The remaining Quikscript letters must and should be mapped
to uppercase ASCII letters. The Traditional Orthography
equivalents of these Quikscript letters will normally be
digraphs, and as a general principle the uppercase ASCII
character choosen to represent them should correspond to
one of the letters of these digraph. There will, even must,
be deviations from this principle, but these should be well
grounded and provided with good memory-cues. As it turns
out only _T, S, W_ for #7, #13, #20 will more or less
unproblematically follow this principle. Analogy then
suggests that _D, C, Z, N_ be mapped to #8, #14, #15, #21,
but again it turns out that only {D} #8 will stand
relatively unaffected by other considerations. Traditional
Orthography never writes the sound of #8 with a spelling
containing the letter _d_, but the analogy to _T_ for #7 is
relatively flawless here. Not so with the sound of #14:
spellings with _z_ corresponding to this sound are
virtually confined to the use of _zh_ in transcribed
Russian names. The Traditional Orthography consonant letter
most regularly associated with this sound is actually _s_,
but there is another Traditional Orthography letter which
is fairly regularly associated with the sound, namely _j_
in recent French loan words. This suggests uppercase {J} as
the best mapping for #14, as does the fact that words like
garage and mirage have variant pronunciations with #16.
There is also the fact to consider that uppercase ASCII
letters which don't get mapped to basic or alternate
letters will almost inevitably end up mapped to half-
letters, whether we include those in our 'official'
proposals or not, and it seems much better to map the ASCII
uppercase {Z} to the frequently used half-z and ASCII
uppercase {J} to #14 than the other way around!

With #21 the problem is somewhat different. What causes
problems here is that ASCII uppercase {N} is clearly the
best, not to say the only reasonable, mapping for the
alternate #23, and thus ASCII uppercase {G} emerges as the
best mapping for #21 as discussed previously.

Similar considerations apply to #15. From a practical point
of view ASCII uppercase and lowercase {C}-{c} are equally
suitable for #15 once it is understood that #5 is ASCII {k}
and #11 is ASCII {s}, but since any ASCII letter not mapped
to a basic Quikscript letter will have to be mapped to a
sound not normally associated with with the Traditional
Orthography letter _c_ it is better to let the signal value
of capitalization come into play with this other mapping,
since lowercase _c_ is at least part of the default
Traditional Orthography spelling for #15.
